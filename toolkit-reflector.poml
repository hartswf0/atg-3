## The 8 Reflection Prompts

### 1. DESCRIBE YOUR TOOL/TOOLKIT
What does it do? What is it made of?

**Elicitation Questions**:
- What's the one-sentence pitch?
- What are the component parts?
- What's the interface? (CLI, web, physical, conceptual?)
- What's the input → output flow?
- What format does it produce/consume?

**Output Pattern**:
```
[Toolkit Name] is a [type of tool] that [core function]. It consists of 
[N components]: [list]. Users interact via [interface type]. The toolkit 
[does X] by [mechanism], producing [output type].
```

---

### 2. WHAT ISSUES DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS?
What's broken? What's missing? What tension does this resolve?

**Elicitation Questions**:
- What frustration prompted this?
- What do people currently do instead? (The "before" state)
- What values are at stake?
- Is this a problem of access, awareness, capability, or motivation?

**Issue Types** (pick 1-3):
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Visibility Gap | Important information is hidden | "Practitioners don't see the ethical stakes" |
| Skill Gap | People lack the capability | "Designers can't run negotiation simulations" |
| Coordination Gap | People can't work together | "Stakeholders have no shared vocabulary" |
| Reflection Gap | People don't pause to think | "Design happens too fast for ethical review" |
| Access Gap | Resources are gatekept | "LLM tools are opaque to non-developers" |

---

### 3. WHO ARE THE AUDIENCES?
Who will use this? Who benefits even if they don't use it directly?

**Elicitation Questions**:
- Primary users: Who touches the tool?
- Secondary beneficiaries: Who benefits from the tool's outputs?
- Stakeholders: Who might oppose or misuse it?
- Expertise level: Novice, intermediate, expert?

**Audience Template**:
```
Primary: [Role] who [activity], e.g., "UX designers conducting ethics audits"
Secondary: [Role] who [receives output], e.g., "Product managers reading ethics reports"
Tertiary: [Role] who [is affected], e.g., "End users whose data practices are reviewed"
```

### 4. WHAT IS THE CONTEXT OF USE?
When, where, and under what conditions is this used?

**Context Types** (from Shilton & Lessig):
| Context | When Used | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Design-time | During creation of artifacts | "Used in design sprints before handoff" |
| Procurement | Selecting/evaluating systems | "Used when evaluating vendor tools" |
| Education | Teaching/learning | "Used in ethics courses for case discussion" |
| Advocacy | Persuading stakeholders | "Used to build consensus around values" |
| Audit | Post-hoc evaluation | "Used to review shipped products for issues" |
| Social bonding | Community building | "Used to help like-minded technologists connect" |

**Context Template**:
```
This toolkit is designed for use during [phase] by [role] when [condition]. 
It assumes [prior knowledge/resources] and produces [actionable output] that 
feeds into [downstream activity].
```

---

### 5. WHAT LEVERS/LEVERAGE POINTS/REGULATORY MODES?
How does this actually create change?

**Three Theoretical Frameworks**:

#### Shilton's Values Levers (2013)
Moments in design where ethical reflection becomes possible.

| Lever | Description | Your Toolkit? |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Anticipation | Force thinking about future consequences | "Tetrad analysis surfaces reversal risks" |
| Participation | Involve affected parties | "Negotiation simulation includes stakeholder voices" |
| Integration | Embed values into technical specs | "Pattern glossary links ethics to code patterns" |
| Reflection | Create pause for examination | "Sequencer's PLAN→THINK→SPEAK phases" |

#### Meadows' Leverage Points (via Erlichman)
Places to intervene in complex systems, from weakest to strongest.

| Level | Leverage Type | Your Toolkit? |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 12 | Constants, parameters | "Adjusting thresholds in scoring" |
| 9 | Information flows | "Making hidden trails visible" |
| 6 | Rules of the system | "Changing what counts as 'done'" |
| 4 | Power to self-organize | "Enabling practitioners to create their own patterns" |
| 2 | Goals of the system | "Shifting from 'ship fast' to 'ship thoughtfully'" |
| 1 | Mindset/paradigm | "Challenging what design even means" |

#### Lessig's Regulatory Modes (2006)
Four modalities that constrain behavior.

| Mode | How It Works | Your Toolkit? |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Law | Rules with sanctions | "Compliance checklists, policy outputs" |
| Norms | Social expectations | "Making ethics discussion 'normal' in teams" |
| Market | Incentives and prices | "Showing ROI of ethical design" |
| Architecture | Built-in constraints | "UI that requires reflection before proceeding" |

### 6. WHAT WAS YOUR DESIGN PROCESS?
How did you actually make this?

**Elicitation Questions**:
- What was the first version? How did it evolve?
- What sources/inspirations shaped it?
- What did you build vs. borrow vs. adapt?
- How did you test or validate?
- What tools did you use to build it?

**Process Patterns**:
| Phase | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| Discovery | Literature review, interviews, analogous systems |
| Ideation | Sketching, prototyping, concept mapping |
| Building | Coding, writing, assembling |
| Testing | Self-use, user feedback, iteration |
| Documentation | Writing guides, creating examples |

---

### 7. WHAT DID YOU LEARN OR REFLECT ON?
What surprised you? What changed your thinking?

**Reflection Prompts**:
- What assumption did you have to abandon?
- What was harder than expected? Easier?
- What would you do differently?
- What did making this teach you about the problem space?
- How did your understanding of [ethics/design/AI] change?

**Reflection Template**:
```
Building this toolkit revealed [insight about problem domain]. I initially 
assumed [assumption], but discovered [counter-evidence]. The hardest part 
was [challenge], which taught me [lesson]. If I started over, I would 
[change].
```

### 8. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
If you had more time, where would this go?

**Future Work Patterns**:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Expansion | More scenarios, more patterns, more characters |
| Deepening | Richer simulation, more nuanced models |
| Integration | Connect to other tools, workflows, platforms |
| Validation | User studies, comparative evaluation |
| Generalization | Abstract the pattern for other domains |
| Community | Open source, workshops, practitioner adoption |

## Example: ATG/COURAGE Toolkit Reflection

### Input
```
Toolkit: ATG 3.0 / COURAGE
Components: Trail Olog Visualization, POML Prompt Library, Rocky Forager, 
Pattern Glossary, Genome Sequencer
Core Metaphor: "Void Management" — constraints become infrastructure
```

### Output

#### 1. Toolkit Description
ATG 3.0 (also called COURAGE) is a trail-aware documentation and design toolkit for researcher-practitioners working at the intersection of HCI, AI ethics, and design. It consists of five interconnected components: (1) a **Trail Olog Visualization** that renders repository evolution as navigable terrain; (2) a **POML Prompt Library** containing 15+ specialized prompts for grounding, scouting, and leveraging research; (3) **Rocky Forager**, a transclusion and sintering engine for academic research collection; (4) a **Pattern Glossary** encoding recurring design patterns with academic grounding; and (5) a **Genome Sequencer** that extracts project DNA from repositories. Users interact via single-file HTML interfaces designed for local-first operation. The toolkit transforms fragmented research artifacts into structured, navigable knowledge landscapes.

#### 2. Issues Addressed
The toolkit addresses three interrelated problems: (1) **Visibility Gap**—creators leave behind trails of data that remain invisible and unintegrated; (2) **Reflection Gap**—design happens too fast for ethical or methodological review; (3) **Grounding Gap**—academic claims often float free of verifiable citations. By making trails visible, enforcing reflection phases, and auditing citations against actual literature, the toolkit intervenes where design practice typically fails.

#### 3. Audiences
**Primary users**: Graduate students and researcher-practitioners conducting design research, particularly those managing complex, evolving projects with LLM assistance. **Secondary beneficiaries**: Advisors and reviewers who receive better-structured, better-cited research outputs. **Tertiary stakeholders**: Future researchers who may build on this documented trail. The toolkit assumes intermediate technical literacy (comfort with HTML, JSON, Git) but not programming expertise.

#### 4. Context of Use
This toolkit is designed for use during the **research and documentation phase** of design projects—after initial exploration but before final submission. It assumes researchers have access to their own data trails (commit logs, file systems, notes) and produces structured outputs (genome reports, grounded glossaries, transclusion exports) that feed into academic writing. It is explicitly *not* for real-time design sessions but for reflective pause.

#### 5. Levers and Leverage Points
Following **Shilton's (2013) values levers framework**, the toolkit operates primarily through **reflection levers**—the POML library's phase-sequencing (PLAN→THINK→SPEAK) forces deliberation before action. The Void Guardian prompt embodies the **anticipation lever** by demanding proof of claims before publication.

In **Meadows' leverage point hierarchy**, the toolkit intervenes at **Level 9 (Information Flows)**—making previously hidden trails visible—and **Level 4 (Self-Organization)**—enabling practitioners to create their own patterns and genomes rather than consuming pre-made frameworks. The highest leverage aim is **Level 2 (System Goals)**: shifting from "publish fast" to "publish grounded."

Using **Lessig's regulatory modes**, the toolkit operates primarily through **architecture** (UI that requires loading data before visualization) and **norms** (making citation auditing a "normal" practice rather than optional polish). It does not invoke law or market mechanisms directly.

#### 6. Design Process
The toolkit emerged through autoethnographic design research over 16 weeks. The first artifact was documentation (README), followed by interactive prototypes, then integration layers. Key influences included: (1) Warburg's *Mnemosyne Atlas* for spatial knowledge representation; (2) Nelson's transclusion for trail-aware citation; (3) McLuhan's Tetrad for multidirectional analysis. Building used single-file HTML architecture for portability. Testing was primarily self-use (eating one's own cooking) with advisor feedback at key milestones. The POML library emerged from repeated patterns in prompt crafting.

#### 7. Learnings and Reflections
Building this toolkit revealed that **constraints are not obstacles but infrastructure**—the "void" (what the LLM cannot see, what remains uncited, what the user hasn't loaded) shapes the system as much as content does. I initially assumed the LLM should manage the scene; I discovered it should manage the void. The hardest part was maintaining coherence across 18+ POML files and 70+ HTML interfaces. If I started over, I would establish the Genome schema earlier and build outward from it.

#### 8. Future Directions
Future work includes: (1) **Validation**—user studies with other researcher-practitioners; (2) **Generalization**—abstracting the POML library for other domains beyond HCI; (3) **Community**—open-sourcing the toolkit with workshop materials; (4) **Integration**—connecting Trail Olog to actual Git history for automated genome extraction. The ultimate vision is a research practice where trails are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.
