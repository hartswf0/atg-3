## Declared Position (No Negotiation)

**Venue**: CHI/DIS-tier HCI conference paper OR Design Issues/Design Studies journal.
NOT a CS systems paper. NOT a philosophy paper. This is DESIGN RESEARCH.

**Audience**: 
- Primary: HCI researchers working on human-AI collaboration
- Secondary: Design researchers interested in generative tools
- Tertiary: STS scholars studying AI infrastructures

**Temporal Priority**:
- 60% post-2020 (contemporary AI/LLM discourse)
- 30% 2010-2020 (foundational HCI + values work)
- 10% classical (Simon, Alexander, Ashby — only if directly mapped)

**Authors to DEFINITELY Engage** (non-negotiable):
| Author | Why | Expected Bond |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| Shneiderman | Human-AI guidelines, HCAI | TENSION — his "human control" may map to agency preservation |
| Norman | Design of complex systems, affordances | PRECURSOR — affordance ≈ void? |
| Dourish | Embodied interaction, context | SUPPORT — his context critique aligns |
| Latour | ANT, inscription, black-boxing | PARALLEL — void as anti-black-box |
| Suchman | Situated action, human-machine reconfig | SUPPORT — mētis-aligned |
| Winograd & Flores | Understanding Computers & Cognition | PRECURSOR — breakdown as void? |
| Agre | Computation and Human Experience | PRECURSOR — deictic vs indexical |

**Authors to PROBABLY Engage**:
| Author | Why | Expected Bond |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| Höök | Somaesthetics, first-person design | PARALLEL — experiential void? |
| Gaver | Ludic design, ambiguity | SUPPORT — ambiguity as void |
| Dunne & Raby | Speculative design | PARALLEL — possibility space |
| Sengers | Reflective design | SUPPORT — values visibility |
| Bowker & Star | Sorting Things Out | SUPPORT — infrastructural inversion |
| Jackson | Repair, breakdown | PARALLEL — maintenance as void work |

**Authors to CUT (not relevant)**:
- Pure ML/NLP researchers (LeCun, Bengio, etc.) — wrong level
- Pure philosophy (Heidegger, Derrida direct) — use design translations
- Business/management (Christensen, Porter) — wrong frame

## Phase 1: IMMEDIATE SINTERING (Execute Now)

### 1.1 Core Term Archaeology

**"Possibility Space"**
- Salen & Zimmerman (2004) — *Rules of Play* — game design origin
- Christopher Alexander (1977) — *A Pattern Language* — "the space of possible buildings"
- Simon (1969) — *Sciences of the Artificial* — "design as search through solution space"
→ THESIS FIT: Void = bounded possibility space. Direct lineage.

**"Cumulative State" / "Context Accumulation"**
- Agre (1997) — *Computation and Human Experience* — indexical vs deictic
- Suchman (1987/2007) — *Human-Machine Reconfigurations* — situated action
- Dourish (2004) — *Where the Action Is* — context as interactional achievement
→ THESIS FIT: Scene = accumulated context. Opposition to situated action.

**"Agency in AI Collaboration"**
- Shneiderman (2020) — "Human-Centered AI" — human control at every level
- Horvitz (1999) — "Principles of Mixed-Initiative Interaction"
- Amershi et al. (2019) — "Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction" (Microsoft)
→ THESIS FIT: Void management preserves agency. Direct support.

**"Bounded Rationality / Cognitive Limits"**
- Simon (1955) — "A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice"
- Kahneman (2011) — *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
- Miller (1956) — "The Magical Number Seven"
→ THESIS FIT: Scene management exceeds cognitive bounds. Classic support.

### 1.4 Gap Identification Targets

Search for papers with these phrases:
- "future work should address how humans maintain control"
- "an open question remains whether users can"
- "we lack frameworks for understanding LLM collaboration"
- "current approaches to prompt engineering fail to"

These signal gaps the thesis fills.

### 1.5 Opposition Sources to Find

Search for STRONGEST counterarguments:
- Papers arguing for MORE autonomous AI (Anthropic scaling papers?)
- Papers showing successful long-context collaboration (RAG success stories)
- Papers where users PREFER complete outputs over options

If found, pre-empt in thesis.

## Sintering Output: First Pass (Execute Without Asking)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TERMINOLOGICAL GROUNDING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**VOID / POSSIBILITY SPACE**

Origin: Game design (Salen & Zimmerman 2004), architecture (Alexander 1977),
        design science (Simon 1969)
        
Key definition (Simon): "Design is a process of search through a vast space
of possible alternatives to find one that satisfies constraints."

DISCIPLINARY VARIANTS:
- Game Design: "possibility space" (what players can do)
- Architecture: "design space" (what buildings can be)
- AI/ML: "latent space" (what models can generate)
- HCI: "interaction space" (what users can do)

THESIS PRECISION: Void = *bounded* possibility space with *fixed dimensions*
and *variable instantiations*. Key distinction from "design space" (which
can be unbounded). Void has WALLS; design space has horizons.

---

**SCENE / CUMULATIVE STATE**

Origin: Cognitive science (situation models), programming (state management)

Key critique (Agre 1997): Systems fail when they try to maintain complete
world models. Indexical representations (relative to agent) scale better
than deictic representations (absolute world state).

THESIS PRECISION: Scene = cumulative state requiring full context to modify.
Scene IS the deictic trap. Void management is indexical—defines relative
transformation possibilities, not absolute content.

---

**COMPLEXITY COLLAPSE / COHERENCE BOUNDS**

Origin: Cybernetics (Ashby 1956), cognitive psychology (Miller 1956),
        design science (Simon 1962)
        
Key formulation (Simon): "The architecture of complexity is the structure
of hierarchical, nearly-decomposable systems."

THESIS TRANSLATION: Scene management produces *non-decomposable* systems.
Void management enforces *near-decomposability* through dimensional bounds.

---

**AGENCY / HUMAN CONTROL**

Origin: Philosophy (Frankfurt 1971), HCI (Shneiderman 2020)

Key framework (Schneiderman): "HCAI systems should keep humans in control,
informed, and in the loop."

THESIS ALIGNMENT: Void management is the architectural mechanism for HCAI.
The void's dimensions are the control surface; instantiation is the exercise
of agency.

PARALLEL DISCOVERIES (LIKELY TO FIND)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Based on thesis structure, predict these parallel works exist:

1. **Prompt Architecture Papers** (2023-2025)
   Someone has probably noticed that prompts are infrastructure, not queries.
   Look for: "prompt engineering" + "design patterns"
   
2. **Context Window Critique** (2024-2025)
   Someone has noticed that long context ≠ better collaboration.
   Look for: "context window" + "cognitive" OR "human"
   
3. **Generative Art Agency** (2020-2025)
   Someone in computational creativity has noticed the agency problem.
   Look for: "generative art" + "human agency" + "control"
   
4. **Structured Generation** (2023-2025)
   Someone is constraining LLM output through structure-first.
   Look for: "structured generation" + "LLM" + "schema"

GAPS THE THESIS FILLS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

GAP 1: MECHANISM GAP
- Literature says: "Humans should stay in control of AI"
- Literature lacks: HOW to architect systems that enable this
- Thesis fills: Void management is the architectural mechanism

GAP 2: SCALE GAP
- Literature addresses: Single-turn or bounded AI interactions
- Literature lacks: Frameworks for iterative, accumulating collaboration
- Thesis fills: Void/scene distinction explains when iteration fails

GAP 3: EXPORT GAP
- Literature assumes: AI outputs are ephemeral or session-bound
- Literature lacks: Design for durable, shareable AI collaboration artifacts
- Thesis fills: Void structures export; scenes don't

GAP 4: EVALUATION GAP
- Literature asks: "Is the output good?"
- Literature lacks: Metrics for process quality in human-AI collaboration
- Thesis fills: Narrative Fidelity as void-completion metric

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OPPOSITION TO PRE-EMPT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OPPOSITION 1: "Bigger context windows solve this"
Source: AI scaling advocates (Anthropic, OpenAI papers)
Pre-emption: Bigger windows don't reduce cognitive load for HUMANS.
             The limit is human coherence, not model context.

OPPOSITION 2: "RAG / external memory solves accumulation"
Source: Enterprise AI papers
Pre-emption: RAG is void management in disguise—it externalizes the 
             void structure. When done well, it's the same principle.

OPPOSITION 3: "Users prefer complete outputs"
Source: UX research on AI assistants
Pre-emption: Short-term preference ≠ long-term success. Users prefer
             complete outputs for single tasks; iterative work fails.
             Distinguish task scope.

OPPOSITION 4: "This is just templates"
Source: Skeptical reviewers
Pre-emption: Templates have fixed slots. Voids have variable dimensionality.
             A 9×9 grid constrains without specifying content. Templates
             specify content structure; voids specify constraint structure.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
POSITIONING STATEMENT (FINAL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The void management thesis sits at the intersection of:

1. **Design Science** (Simon) — applying bounded rationality to AI collaboration
2. **Situated Action** (Suchman, Agre) — rejecting complete world models
3. **Human-Centered AI** (Shneiderman) — providing architectural mechanism
4. **Infrastructure Studies** (Bowker, Star) — making the invisible visible
5. **Reflective Design** (Sengers, Gaver) — designing for values visibility

It is NOT:
- A machine learning contribution (no new models)
- A philosophy paper (applied, not theoretical)
- A systems paper (design framework, not implementation)

It IS:
- A design research contribution proposing an architectural principle
- Grounded in practice (150+ hours), theorized through established HCI frames
- Falsifiable and bounded in scope
