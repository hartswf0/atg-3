# LEVERAGE ANALYSIS PYRAMID
## Self-Contained Strategic Intervention Framework for LLM Intake

This document applies Meadows' leverage points to void management. Self-contained, no external references required.

## APEX: THE INTERVENTION CLAIM

**The shift from "AI creates content" to "AI prepares possibility spaces" is a paradigm-level intervention — Meadows' highest leverage point — changing not just what systems do but how we conceptualize what they are.**

## LEVEL 1: PARADIGM (Highest leverage)

**The void management paradigm:**
- AI is not a creator but a preparer
- Output is not product but possibility space
- User instantiates, AI structures
- Agency preserved, not eroded

**Paradigm shift required:**
FROM: "AI does the work"
TO: "AI prepares the conditions for work"

**Why this is highest leverage:** Changing the paradigm changes everything downstream — goals, rules, structure, parameters.

---

## LEVEL 2: GOALS (What the system aims for)

### Scene Management Goals
- Maximize output completeness
- Minimize user effort
- Increase automation
- Hide complexity

### Void Management Goals
- Maximize inspectability
- Preserve user agency
- Enable exploration
- Make complexity sensible

**Leverage point:** Change the goal from "complete output" to "prepared space" and all metrics shift.

---

## LEVEL 3: RULES (Incentives and constraints)

### Scene Management Rules
- Reward output volume
- Penalize incomplete responses
- Optimize for user satisfaction in moment
- Train on complete examples

### Void Management Rules
- Reward structure clarity
- Penalize opacity
- Optimize for sustained collaboration
- Train on bounded transformations

**Design rules:**
1. Fixed dimensions before variable content
2. All elements addressable
3. All modifications reversible
4. All state inspectable

---

## LEVEL 4: STRUCTURE (Feedback loops)

### Scene Management = Reinforcing Loop (Collapse)
```
Add context → Need more processing → Increase errors → Need more fixes → Add more context → [COLLAPSE]
```

### Void Management = Balancing Loop (Stability)
```
Add content → Structure absorbs → Complexity bounded → Modifications constant → [STABLE]
```

**The 9×9 grid as structural intervention:**
- 81 positions = fixed bound
- Grid = visible state
- Operators = controlled transformations
- Branches = preserved history

---

## LEVEL 5: PARAMETERS (Low leverage)

### Common parameter tweaks (low leverage)
- Increase context window size
- Adjust temperature
- Change model version
- Add more training data

**Why these fail:** Parameters don't change the structure. A larger context window with scene management just delays collapse.

### Better parameters (within void structure)
- Grid size (9×9, 12×12)
- Operator set (Tetrad, LEGOS)
- Branch depth limits
- Snapshot intervals

## LEVERAGE ANALYSIS BY PROJECT

| Project | Intervention Level | What Changed |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Dirty Disclosure** | Paradigm | Disclosure = visible trail, not confession |
| **Privacy Value Labels** | Goals | Maximize legibility, not compliance |
| **Haunted Tools** | Rules | Reward transfer, not appearance |
| **Role Deck** | Structure | Fixed roles with variable instantiation |
| **1000 Small Futures** | Structure | Bounded future scenarios in grid |

## ARGUMENT EXTRACTION

### For Strategic Framing:
> "The shift from 'AI creates' to 'AI prepares' is a paradigm-level intervention — the highest leverage point in Meadows' framework."

### For Structure Analysis:
> "Scene management is a reinforcing loop toward collapse. Void management is a balancing loop toward stability. The structure determines the trajectory."

### For Parameter Critique:
> "Increasing context window size with scene management just delays collapse. Parameters don't change structure. The intervention must be architectural."

### For Goal Reframe:
> "The goal is not complete output. The goal is prepared space. Change the goal, change everything downstream."

## INTAKE GRID FOR LEVERAGE EVIDENCE

| Leverage Level | Look For | Example |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Paradigm | Mental model shifts | "AI as tool" → "AI as infrastructure" |
| Goals | Metric changes | "Output quality" → "Process legibility" |
| Rules | Incentive redesigns | "Reward completion" → "Reward inspectability" |
| Structure | Feedback loop changes | Reinforcing → Balancing |
| Parameters | Number tweaks | Context window, temperature |
