# LIFE AFTER BOB LINEAGE PYRAMID
## Self-Contained Digital Archaeology Framework for LLM Intake

This document presents the reconstruction of Ian Cheng's simulation art lineage. Self-contained, no external references required.

## APEX: THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CLAIM

**The "Ted Chiang Hypothesis" reveals cultural convergence: viewers read complex simulation art through the lens of literary speculative fiction. Life After BOB is a "literary simulation" — a hybrid form demanding both art-historical and literary-critical analysis.**

## LEVEL 1: LINEAGE (The corrected attribution)

### The Chiang Confusion
- **Ted Chiang:** Speculative fiction author (Story of Your Life, etc.)
- **Ian Cheng:** Simulation artist (Life After BOB, Emissaries)
- **Why confusion matters:** Thematic convergence — both explore consciousness, free will, algorithmic determinism

### The Ian Cheng Reality
| Evidence Tier | Source | Function |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Primary** | Institutional commissions (The Shed, Luma, LAS) | Provenance |
| **Secondary** | Production credits (Metis Suns) | Attribution |
| **Tertiary** | Collaborator portfolios (Tramontini, Getov) | Technical details |

### The Studio Model
Not solitary artist but **director orchestrating technical team** — bridging white cube and code repository.

---

## LEVEL 2: PRODUCTION (The collaborative team)

### Key Agents

| Role | Person | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Director/Screenwriter** | Ian Cheng | Conceptual architect, system design |
| **Lead Unity/Environment** | Shuruq Tramontini | World builder, Wavyverse landscapes |
| **Technical Director** | Ivaylo Getov | Systems engineer, Unity cinematics |
| **Producer** | Veronica So | Logistical anchor, "co-parent" of simulations |

### Tramontini's Contribution
- Environment design, foliage spawners
- Wavyverse aesthetic (lush, messy, lived-in)
- Architectural background (Vienna) informs spatial logic
- "Breakdown" documents = blueprints of simulation

### The Production Model
- Weekly production meetings
- "Software building" approach to movie making
- Unity 2019/2020 LTS
- SGI supercomputers (historical Darwin project)

---

## LEVEL 3: EVOLUTION (Agent to cyborg)

### The Agent Genealogy

| Era | Work | Agent Type | Behavior |
|-----|------|------------|----------|
| 2015-2018 | **Emissaries Trilogy** | Chaotic, feral | Emergent, uncontrolled |
| 2018-2019 | **BOB (Bag of Beliefs)** | Complex personality | Singular AI, learnable |
| 2019-2021 | **Life After BOB** | Narrative-constrained cyborg | Scripted + emergent |
| 2023+ | **Thousand Lives** | Pure agent (turtle) | Sisyphean, bound to fail |

### The Chalice Study
- AI entity "BOB" co-pilots protagonist's nervous system
- Executes life scripts more efficiently than human
- Technology mediates self to point of obsolescence
- Classic Chiangian territory realized through simulation

### Thousand Lives: The Return
- Turtle AI in apartment environment
- Designed to fail at optimization = narrative pathos
- "Sisyphean simulation" — tragedy enacted by software
- Return to pure, unscripted agent simulation

---

## LEVEL 4: PRESERVATION (Obsolescence risks)

### The Unity Trap

| Risk | Mechanism | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Engine deprecation** | Unity render pipeline updates | Critical |
| **Build fragility** | Project built in specific Unity version (2019-2020 LTS) | High |
| **Live paradox** | Real-time execution required, not just video playback | Critical |
| **Physics engine** | PhysX updates break behavior | Medium |

**The paradox:** "Live" nature is aesthetic strength and archival weakness.

### Platform Rot

| Component | Dependency | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Worldwatching app** | iOS/Android updates | Vulnerable |
| **Wiki** | Domain hosting | Endangered |
| **True Name NFT** | Tezos blockchain, wallet apps | Interface fragile |
| **Server-client sync** | Local exhibition infrastructure | Ephemeral |

### Preservation Requirements
- Entire development environment, not just executable
- Archive code, wiki, breakdown assets, oral history
- Preserve the system, not just the output

---

## LEVEL 5: RECOVERY (Missing artifacts)

### Critical Gaps

| Gap Type | Missing Material | Recovery Target |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Visual breakdowns** | Thousand Lives environment construction | Tramontini portfolio |
| **Worldwatching UI** | Mobile interface screenshots | Exhibition documentation |
| **BTS footage** | Unity editor during production | Getov's lecture materials |
| **Wiki edit history** | Collaborative worlding process | lifeafterbob.wiki |
| **Technical rider** | Unity version, hardware specs | PDF installation manuals |

### The Wiki as Living Archive
- Intra-diegetic archive (written from fictional universe perspective)
- Contains creator metadata intertwined with lore
- Blurs line between fiction and reality
- Edit history reveals collaborative worlding

### Non-English Documentation
| Region | Key Sources | Unique Framing |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Korea (Leeum)** | Technical co-production, app development | Gaming culture interface |
| **Spain (Matadero)** | "Mil vidas" curatorial texts | Post-humanism, non-human agency |
| **China (Douban)** | Reviews under "圣杯实验" | Anime aesthetic, Three-Body comparison |
| **Germany (LAS Berlin)** | Berghain installation | Industrial scale, transformative futures |

## THE THREE LINEAGES

### 1. Agent Lineage (The Code)
Emissaries (chaos) → BOB (personality) → Life After BOB (narrative cyborg) → Thousand Lives (pure agent)

### 2. Visual Lineage (The World)
Tramontini's Wavyverse: architectural theory + biophilic design + "messy" materiality
- Background: Baghdad → Dubai → Vienna
- "Liquid architecture" of displacement and adaptability

### 3. Collaborative Lineage (The Studio)
Stable "dev team" model replaces solitary artist myth:
- Cheng (director) + So (producer) + Getov (tech) + Tramontini (environment)
- Weekly meetings, version control, playtesting

---

## ARGUMENT EXTRACTION

### For Attribution Correction:
> "The Ted Chiang Hypothesis is factually erroneous but culturally diagnostic. It reveals viewers increasingly read complex simulation art through the lens of literary speculative fiction."

### For Studio Model:
> "The Ian Cheng Reality is not one of a solitary genius but of a director orchestrating a complex technical team, bridging the gap between the white cube of the gallery and the code repository of the game developer."

### For Preservation:
> "The 'live' nature of the simulation is its greatest aesthetic strength and its greatest archival weakness. To preserve the work, one must preserve the entire development environment, not just the executable."

### For Visual Lineage:
> "Tramontini's Wavyverse aesthetic grounds abstract AI concepts in a lush, detailed, 'messy' material world — a 'liquid architecture' informed by her nomadic biography."

## INTAKE GRID FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOURCES

| Evidence Type | Look For | Maps To |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Institutional credits | Exhibition catalogs, press releases | LINEAGE |
| Technical portfolios | Breakdown videos, Unity screenshots | PRODUCTION |
| Agent behavior documentation | AI architecture, behavior trees | EVOLUTION |
| Preservation assessments | Technical riders, dependency lists | PRESERVATION |
| Missing artifacts | Archived pages, ephemeral interfaces | RECOVERY |

---

## LINK TO VOID MANAGEMENT

**Life After BOB demonstrates bounded simulation architecture:**

| BOB Principle | Void Management Parallel |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Director sets initial conditions | Human instantiates void |
| Agents operate within constraints | Content fills bounded structure |
| Emergence happens within bounds | Complexity bounded by grid |
| "Worldwatching" = inspectable state | State remains visible |
| Infinite duration possible | Sustained without collapse |

**Cheng's shift from chaos (Emissaries) to constraint (BOB) parallels the move from scene management to void management.**
