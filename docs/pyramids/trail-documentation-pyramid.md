# TRAIL DOCUMENTATION PYRAMID
## Self-Contained Project Narrative for LLM Intake

This document traces the evolution of the void management thesis through project iterations. Self-contained, no external references required.

## APEX: THE NARRATIVE CLAIM

**The void management thesis was discovered, not invented — emerging from the documented failure of scene-managed projects and iterative design research over fifteen weeks.**

## LEVEL 1: INSIGHT (The discovered principle)

**The jar principle:** The void doesn't fill the wilderness — it organizes it.

Derived from Wallace Stevens:
> I placed a jar in Tennessee,
> And round it was, upon a hill.
> It made the slovenly wilderness
> Surround that hill.

**Design translation:** Provide bounded structure. Let humans instantiate. Complexity becomes sensible.

---

## LEVEL 2: PIVOTS (The turning points)

### Pivot 1: TILTH → Thousand-Tetrad
- **From:** World-inside-world speculation
- **To:** Parasitic on existing worlds
- **Reason:** Couldn't maintain world coherence
- **Result:** Freed resources for tool building

### Pivot 2: Scene Building → Void Preparation
- **From:** LLM constructs scenes
- **To:** LLM manages bounded grid
- **Reason:** Fine-grain control frustration
- **Result:** LLM as gatekeeper, not builder

### Pivot 3: 2D → 3D
- **From:** Text/chat interfaces
- **To:** Spatial visualization
- **Reason:** Need to share outputs cinematically
- **Result:** HOLO Project, TRACTOR-DCE-GYO

## LEVEL 3: FAILURES (The lessons)

### TILTH Failure
**What:** Speculative investigation of speculative company
**Symptoms:**
- Scenarios convoluted quickly
- Each addition made whole harder
- "Trough of quality" — almost good enough, never finished
- Context grew, completion cost grew exponentially

**Diagnosis:** Scene management pathology

### API Cost Failure
**What:** 100+ test scenes, API bleeding
**Symptoms:**
- Couldn't afford sustained testing
- Collaborators needed my API key
- Technical uncanny valley — too complex for designers, too simple for engineers

**Diagnosis:** Economic unsustainability of scene approach

### World Absorption Failure (Jordan Caldwell)
**What:** Black Metal scenarios from physical book
**Symptoms:**
- System couldn't absorb world variety quickly
- Complex training ground exceeded intake capacity

**Diagnosis:** Bounded structure needed, not unbounded absorption

---

## LEVEL 4: ATTEMPTS (The experiments)

### Early Experiments
- **Role Deck** — character-based scenario tools
- **LEGOS Framework** — Location, Entities, Goals, Obstacles, Shifts
- **Tetrad Pad** — McLuhan operators as prompt controller

### Middle Experiments
- **Nexadoc-Jar** — Ekphrasis meets prompt chains (discovery moment)
- **Thousand-Tetrad** — 9×9 grid, 67 scenarios, 4 collaborators

### Late Experiments
- **HOLO Project** — 3D prebaked narratives
- **TRACTOR-DCE-GYO** — Full tool suite, linear algebra

---

## LEVEL 5: ARTIFACTS (The evidence)

### Projects (10)
Dirty Disclosure, Privacy Value Labels, Haunted Tools, Role Deck, Lil Echoes, Design Space Mapper, 1000 Small Futures, Reflexive Reframe, Disclosure Inspector, Digital Seed

### Documentation (26 .md files)
From brainstorms to final submissions, trail fully documented

### POML Files (18)
Meta-prompts that write prompts — the void management approach to prompt engineering

### Collaborators (4)
- Tehri Marttila — 3 months weekly, computational humanities
- Jordan Caldwell — speculative design, Black Metal
- Kayla Evans — responsible AI, ethical negotiation
- Shuruq Tramontini — narrative AI, 1000 Lives

## ARGUMENT EXTRACTION

### For Research Narrative:
> "The thesis emerged from failure. TILTH exhibited scene management pathology: scenarios convoluted, each addition made whole harder, context grew, completion cost grew exponentially. The pivot to bounded structures was forced by reality."

### For Methodology:
> "Fifteen weeks of design research with four collaborators testing across domains. The void pattern enabled productive collaboration even when implementation was fragile."

### For Discovery Claim:
> "The breakthrough came from investigating ekphrasis — verbal description of visual art. While building prompt/completion chains, the complexity of TILTH gave way to the simplicity of the jar."
