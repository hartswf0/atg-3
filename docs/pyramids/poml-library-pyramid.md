## APEX: THE META-PROMPT CLAIM

**Writing prompts that write prompts is a valid mode of sophisticated AI collaboration. POML is a layered prompt engineering system that produces structured analytical outputs through meta-prompt composition.**

## LEVEL 1: THESIS (The meta-prompt principle)

**Core insight:** Prompts can be treated as objects with:
- Properties (context, intent, constraints)
- Methods (transformations, compositions)
- Inheritance (base prompts extended)

**Why meta-prompts work:**
- Reduce cognitive load per interaction
- Enable compositional complexity
- Create reusable analytical components
- Produce consistent structured outputs

---

## LEVEL 2: PATTERNS (Reusable structures)

### Pattern: Sinter
**Purpose:** Compress multiple sources into unified argument
**Structure:**
```
INPUT: Multiple texts
OPERATION: Extract core claims, find convergences, resolve contradictions
OUTPUT: Unified synthesis with source attribution
```

### Pattern: Forensic
**Purpose:** Deep investigation of single artifact
**Structure:**
```
INPUT: Single document or artifact
OPERATION: Layer-by-layer analysis, evidence extraction, gap identification
OUTPUT: Structured archaeological report
```

### Pattern: Mythos
**Purpose:** Narrative extraction
**Structure:**
```
INPUT: Project or situation
OPERATION: Identify characters, conflicts, transformations, resolutions
OUTPUT: Story structure with thematic analysis
```

### Pattern: Recursive
**Purpose:** Self-referential analysis
**Structure:**
```
INPUT: The analysis process itself
OPERATION: Meta-analysis of methodology
OUTPUT: Reflexive critique with improvements
```

## LEVEL 3: OPERATORS (Transformations)

### The Tetrad Operators (McLuhan)
- **Enhance:** What does this amplify?
- **Obsolesce:** What does this make obsolete?
- **Retrieve:** What does this bring back?
- **Reverse:** What does this become when pushed to extreme?

### The LEGOS Operators
- **Location:** Where does this happen?
- **Entities:** Who/what is involved?
- **Goals:** What is being pursued?
- **Obstacles:** What blocks progress?
- **Shifts:** What changes resolve the situation?

### Composition Operators
- **Chain:** Output of one becomes input of next
- **Parallel:** Multiple analyses on same input
- **Branch:** Conditional operators based on input properties
- **Merge:** Multiple outputs combined into single structure

---

## LEVEL 4: PRIMITIVES (Building blocks)

### Context Primitives
- **Role:** The persona the LLM adopts
- **Task:** The specific objective
- **Constraints:** Limits on output
- **Format:** Structure of response

### Output Primitives
- **Claim:** A falsifiable statement
- **Evidence:** Supporting data
- **Mechanism:** Explanatory process
- **Implication:** Downstream consequence

### Process Primitives
- **Intake:** How input is absorbed
- **Transform:** How input becomes output
- **Validate:** How output is checked
- **Export:** How output is formatted

---

## LEVEL 5: EXAMPLES (Specific POMls)

### sinter.poml
Compresses multiple research papers into unified academic positioning document.

### forensic.poml
Investigates single artifact for hidden structure, gaps, and evidence.

### mythos.poml
Extracts narrative structure from project evolution.

### recursive.poml
Analyzes its own analysis process for improvement.

### inverse-essay.poml
Reconstructs what would have to be true for an argument to hold.

### parody.poml
Generates satirical version to expose assumptions.

### meta-prime.poml
Generates prompts that generate prompts.

## ARGUMENT EXTRACTION

### For Meta-Prompt Justification:
> "Writing prompts that write prompts is a valid mode of sophisticated AI collaboration. This is not abstraction for its own sake — it reduces cognitive load per interaction and enables compositional complexity."

### For Pattern Description:
> "POML patterns are reusable analytical components: Sinter compresses, Forensic investigates, Mythos narrates, Recursive reflects. Each transforms input according to specified operations."

### For Operator Explanation:
> "McLuhan's Tetrad (Enhance/Obsolesce/Retrieve/Reverse) and LEGOS (Location/Entities/Goals/Obstacles/Shifts) provide the transformation grammar. Operators can be chained, paralleled, branched, and merged."
