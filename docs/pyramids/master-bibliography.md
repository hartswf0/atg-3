## TIER 1: FOUNDATIONAL (Appear in 4+ pyramids)

### Donella Meadows — Systems Thinking
**Pyramids:** Void Management, Leverage Analysis, Context-Material, Sinter Report, Paragon Essay
**Work:** *Thinking in Systems* (2008)
**Key Concepts:**
- 12 leverage points for system intervention
- Paradigm = highest leverage (changing mental models)
- Reinforcing loops → runaway behavior
- Balancing loops → stability

**Void Management Application:**
> "Scene management = reinforcing loop toward collapse. Void management = balancing loop toward stability."

---

### Clifford Geertz — Anthropology
**Pyramids:** Context-Material, Context-Engineering, Sinter Report, Paragon Essay
**Work:** *The Interpretation of Cultures* (1973), "Thick Description"
**Key Concepts:**
- Thin description: physical mechanics (eyelid contracts)
- Thick description: interpretive meaning (a wink, a conspiracy)
- "Webs of significance"

**Void Management Application:**
> "LLMs need 'thick' context — not just facts but cultural codes, behavioral norms, situational appropriateness."

---

### Lucy Suchman — HCI/Situated Cognition
**Pyramids:** Context-Material, Context-Engineering, Void Management, Paragon Essay
**Work:** *Plans and Situated Actions* (1987)
**Key Concepts:**
- Intelligence is not abstract process but emergent from agent-environment interaction
- Plans are resources, not controllers

---

### Andrej Karpathy — AI/Context Engineering
**Pyramids:** Context-Material, Context-Engineering, Sinter Report, POML Library

## TIER 2: SUPPORTING (Appear in 2-3 pyramids)

### James C. Scott — Political Philosophy
**Pyramids:** Void Management, Sinter Report, Paragon Essay

---

### Roland Barthes — Semiotics
**Pyramids:** Void Management, Paragon Essay
**Work:** *Mythologies* (1957)
**Key Concepts:**
- Myths naturalize ideology
- Mythologies hide labor

---

### Ian Cheng — Simulation Art
**Pyramids:** Simulation/Worldbuilding, Life After BOB
**Work:** Life After BOB (2021), Emissaries Trilogy (2015-2017)
**Key Concepts:**

---

### Hoare / Dijkstra — Computer Science
**Pyramids:** Negative Space, Context-Material
**Works:** Hoare's null reference (1965), Dijkstra's GOTO considered harmful (1968)
**Key Concepts:**
- Billion-dollar mistake (null as type hole)
- Structured programming (topological constraint)
- Assertions as state boundaries

**Void Management Application:**
> "The grid eliminates invalid states. Position (10,10) is unrepresentable."

---

## TIER 3: SPECIALIZED (Appear in 1 pyramid, critical)

### Bertrand Meyer — Design by Contract
**Pyramid:** Negative Space
**Work:** *Object-Oriented Software Construction* (1988)
**Key Concepts:**
- Preconditions (requires), postconditions (ensures)
- Class invariants
- "Ghost evidence" — when contracts exhaustive, defensive code vanishes

---

### Shigeo Shingo — Poka-yoke
**Pyramid:** Negative Space
**Work:** Toyota Production System (1960s)
**Key Concepts:**
- Mistake-proofing: make error physically impossible
- Contact method, fixed-value method, sequence method
- Prevention over correction

---

### Vladimir Parondzhanov — DRAKON
**Pyramid:** Negative Space
**Work:** DRAKON visual language (Buran, 1980s)
**Key Concepts:**
- The "skewer" (main path as vertical line)
- No crossing lines
- Invalid logic looks ugly

---

### James Jessiman — LDraw
**Pyramid:** Digital LEGO Ecosystem
**Work:** LDraw standard (1995)
**Key Concepts:**
- Brick as linguistic construct (plain text, vector geometry)
- Open standard survival 30 years
- Community outpaced corporation

---

### Eric Berne — Transactional Analysis
**Pyramid:** Life After BOB
**Work:** *Games People Play* (1964)
**Key Concepts:**
- Life scripts
- Transactions between ego states
- Automate introspection

---

### Julian Jaynes — Bicameral Mind
**Pyramid:** Life After BOB
**Work:** *The Origin of Consciousness* (1976)
**Key Concepts:**
- Bicameral mind: commanding voice + obeying self
- Consciousness as cultural evolution
- BOB as external commanding voice

---

### Marshall McLuhan — Media Theory

**Work:** *Understanding Media* (1964), Tetrad
**Key Concepts:**
- Tetrad: Enhance, Obsolesce, Retrieve, Reverse
- Medium is the message
- Hot vs cool media

---
