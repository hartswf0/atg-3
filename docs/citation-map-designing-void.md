# Citation Map: Designing the Void — Agency, Context, and Ontological Drift
## Placing 35 Sources on the Project Landscape

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Map the CORE theoretical framework to project implementation

---

## ⚠️ THIS IS THE CENTRAL DOCUMENT

This paper defines the **exact vocabulary** the project uses:

| Term | Definition | Project Implementation |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| **The Void** | Latent possibility space of model | What POML operators constrain |
| **The Scene** | Accumulated context | `wag-atlas.json`, conversation history |
| **Sintering** | Apply heat/pressure to consolidate | `sinter.poml` operator! |
| **Quasi-Creature** | AI entity — too agentic for tool, too unreliable for partner | What we're designing for |
| **Seamful Design** | Expose constraints, don't hide them | `intervention-atlas.html` |
| **Process Alignment** | Align on HOW, not just output | POML structure |

---

## THE BINDING THESIS

> "The central design challenge of the generative era is not the refinement of model accuracy or the expansion of context windows, but the **management of the Void**—a high-dimensional, probabilistic possibility space—and its counterpart, the **Scene**—the accumulated, situated context that constrains this space."

**This IS the project's thesis.**

## CITATION → PROJECT MAPPING

### TIER 1: FOUNDATIONAL THEORY (Already in `verified-references.md`)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 1, 2 | Norman | Gulf of Execution, Constraints | **Existing reference** | foundation |
| 3 | Winograd & Flores | Breakdown, ready-to-hand | **Quasi-Creature theory** | `void-management-thesis-paper.md` |
| 28 | Suchman | Situated Action | **Already mapped** | `context-as-material-pyramid.md` |
| 6 | Agre | Capture, grammar of action | **Critical theory** | `context-engineering-pyramid.md` |
| 5 | Simon | Design as search | **Solution space** | design theory |
| 9 | Latour | Actor-Network Theory | **Already mapped** | `intervention-atlas.html` |

**These are already in the theoretical foundation — verify presence in `/pyramids/`.**

---

### TIER 2: THE VOID/SCENE VOCABULARY

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 3 | Quasi-Creature paper | Uncanny Valley of Agency | **Core thesis** | `void-management-thesis-paper.md` |
| 4, 11 | Seamful XAI | Expose seams, not seamlessness | **Design principle** | `intervention-atlas.html` |
| 10 | Terry et al. | Process Alignment (Spec/Process/Eval) | **POML structure** | all `.poml` files |
| 12 | Scott — Legibility | State simplification | **Already verified** | `verified-references.md` |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "We are witnessing the dissolution of the tool metaphor and the emergence of a new, unstable category of technological existence: the 'Quasi-Creature'."

**Place in:** `void-management-thesis-paper.md` → Introduction

### TIER 3: SINTERING (The Project's Core Metaphor!)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Paper itself | Sintering definition | "Apply heat/pressure without melting" | **`sinter.poml`** | DIRECT CONNECTION |
| 16, 17 | Many-Shot ICL (Anthropic) | Terraforming the Void | **Context Engineering** | pyramids |
| 18, 19 | PromptCanvas | Dynamic Widgets | **Affordance design** | future UI |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "Sintering is the process of compacting a granular material into a solid mass using heat or pressure without melting it to the point of liquefaction. In generative design, the user applies 'heat' (prompts, constraints, context) to the granular dust of the Void to solidify it into a usable 'Scene.'"

**This quote DEFINES `sinter.poml`!**

---

### TIER 4: SCENE MANAGEMENT

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 20, 21 | Cognitive Workspace | Active Memory Management | **Scene pathology** | `grounded-theory-paper.md` |
| 23, 24 | CoThinker | Cognitive Overload | **Context degradation** | sinter-report |
| 25 | Dourish | Context as interactional achievement | **Embodied Interaction** | pyramids |
| 25 | Chinese Painters study | Identity negotiation | **Longitudinal drift** | empirical |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "Too little context: The Void is unconstrained; the model drifts. Too much context: The Scene is unmanageable; the user loses agency."

**This is the Context Degradation Syndrome formalized.**

---

### TIER 5: INTERFACE PARADIGMS

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 32, 33 | DeckFlow | Infinite Canvas, Task Decomposition | **ATG terrain** | `atg-3-unified.html` |
| 18, 34 | PromptCanvas | Dynamic Widgets, Affordances | **Future UI** | design implications |
| 29, 30, 31 | AsyncVoice Agent | Process Fidelity, Barge-in | **Real-time alignment** | agent design |
| 14, 35 | Prover-Verifier Games | Legibility training | **Verification** | guardian model |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "DeckFlow introduces the concept of Task Decomposition via 'Cards': Goal Cards, Action Cards, Cluster Cards. This spatial arrangement externalizes cognitive load."

---

### TIER 6: AGENCY AND ALIGNMENT

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 7 | Shneiderman | Human-Centered AI, control spectrum | **Already verified** | foundation |
| 8 | Model collapse / homogenization | Too much control = lose generative advantage | **Balance** | design principle |
| 10 | Terry et al. — Three Alignments | Specification / Process / Evaluation | **Tripartite model** | core framework |

**The Terry Alignment Framework:**

| Alignment Type | Focus | Current State | Project Response |
|----------------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Specification** | WHAT to do | Prompt Engineering (weak) | POML structure |
| **Process** | HOW to do it | Black-boxed (missing!) | Seamful design, POML |
| **Evaluation** | Quality of result | RLHF, editing (shallow) | Guardian model |

| Dimension | The Tool (Classical) | The Quasi-Creature (Generative) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Paradigm | Command-based | Intent-based (probability) |
| Ontology | Deterministic, Passive | Probabilistic, Agentic |

## STAGES OF IDENTITY NEGOTIATION

From the Chinese Painters longitudinal study (Citation #25):

| Stage | User Perception | Scene Role | Friction |
|-------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Initial | AI as Novelty | Minimal | "It doesn't understand me" |
| Exploration | AI as Apprentice | Accumulating | "I need to teach it my style" |
| Integration | AI as Partner | Deep Persona | **"Who is the author?"** |
| Resistance | AI as Threat | Saturation | "It's copying me too well" |

**The project's collaborators (Wentworth, Caldwell, etc.) are in stages 3-4.**

## THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES EXTRACTED

From "Designing the Void" — actionable for project:

1. **Seamful over Seamless**: Expose constraints, uncertainties, decision points
2. **Process over Output**: Align on HOW, not just WHAT
3. **Sintering over Generating**: Apply pressure to consolidate, don't just produce
4. **Legibility over Magic**: Make the Void's operations inspectable
5. **Canvas over Chat**: Spatial decomposition over linear serialization
6. **Barge-in over Wait**: Real-time intervention during generation

*This document provides the theoretical vocabulary that unifies all project artifacts. "Sintering" is not a metaphor we invented — it's a term from the literature that perfectly describes `sinter.poml`.*
