## dirty-disclosure
**Week 1 — Looking at Toolkits (Asynchronous)**

### About this Project
Dirty Disclosure examines AI disclosure theatre through Gregory Bateson's double bind framework. It explores how transparency mandates create impossible situations: hide AI involvement and be deemed deceitful, reveal it and be deemed impure.

**Impetus & foundation.** This build is inspired by the Week 1 asynchronous activity:

- **Class Activity:** Look around on https://everydayethics.uxp2.com/methods/ and try out one or two of the activities
- **Reflection questions:** What is the intended "theory of change" behind this activity? What are potential challenges or barriers to creating that change?

This project responds to those questions by exposing the double binds embedded in disclosure-as-toolkit. It asks: what happens when the "ethics tool" itself creates ethical traps?

**Key concepts:**
- Turing Test as legibility performance
- Double bind: hide=deceitful, reveal=impure
- Proof-of-transparency as proof-of-guilt
- Disclosure theatre

**Week 1 activity prompts addressed:**
- Who is the intended user of this activity/method?
- What is the intended "theory of change"?
- What are potential challenges or barriers to actually creating that change?

## privacy-value-labels
**Week 3 — What is a social value? Privacy as a case study**

### About this Project
Privacy Value Labels is a compact, mobile-first interface for working with Contextual Integrity (CI). It brings together three complementary views that share one canonical dataset and work fully offline.

- **Label** — quick, phone-friendly summary
- **Deck** — editable, suited 14 dimensions  
- **Learn** — guided CI overview + dimension cards

**Impetus & foundation.** This build is inspired by, and operationalizes ideas from:

- **Privacy is an essentially contested concept: a multi-dimensional analytic for mapping privacy** — Deirdre K. Mulligan, Colin Koopman, Nick Doty.
  A call to treat privacy as multi-dimensional; this UI turns that analytic into a practical worksheet.

- **Contextual Integrity, Explained: A More Usable Privacy Definition** — Nathan Malkin.
  A clear, applied introduction to CI; this project turns that clarity into hands-on labeling and learning tools.

- **Towards Creating Infrastructures for Values and Ethics Work in the Production of Software Technologies** — Richmond Y. Wong.
  This app aims to be an enabling infrastructure, with the two readings above as assigned foundations propelling the build.

**Week 3 readings:**
- Malkin, Nathan. "Contextual Integrity, Explained." IEEE Security & Privacy 21, no. 01 (2023): 58–65. doi:10.1109/MSEC.2022.3201585
- Mulligan, Deirdre K., Colin Koopman, and Nick Doty. "Privacy Is an Essentially Contested Concept." Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A 374, no. 2083 (2016): 1–17. doi:10.1098/rsta.2016.0118

## liberty-machines
**Week 4 — Modes of Action**

### About this Project
Liberty Machines explores Lessig's "Pathetic Dot" theory through interactive scenarios. It maps how Law, Norms, Market, and Code constrain the individual—using the cigarette pack as a case study in freedom theatre.

**Impetus & foundation.** This build is inspired by, and operationalizes ideas from:

- **Code Version 2.0, Chapter 7: "What Things Regulate"** — Lawrence Lessig.
  The foundational framework: four modalities (Law, Norms, Market, Architecture/Code) regulate behavior. This project makes those forces tangible and interactive.

- **Values Levers: Building Ethics into Design** — Katie Shilton.
  How designers can create "values levers" that open space for ethical consideration; this project treats the four modalities as such levers.

- **Creating Standards: Our Secret Job as Researchers** — Danny Spitzberg.
  Standards as a mode of action; this project examines how standards become instruments of both liberation and control.

**Key concepts:**
- Lessig's Pathetic Dot (individual constrained by four forces)
- Freedom theatre: the performance of choice within constrained systems
- Second-order control shapes first-order freedom
- The cigarette pack as microcosm of regulated liberty

**Week 4 readings:**
- Lessig, Lawrence. "What Things Regulate." In Code Version 2.0. Basic Books, 2006. (Chapter 7, pages 120-137) https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Code_v2.pdf
- Shilton, Katie. "Values Levers: Building Ethics into Design." Science, Technology, & Human Values 38, no. 3 (2013): 374–97. doi:10.1177/0162243912436985
- Spitzberg, Danny. "Creating Standards: Our Secret Job as Researchers." Interactions 30, no. 5 (2023): 39–43. doi:10.1145/3615670

## haunted-tools
**Week 5 — Toolkits and Their Limits**

### About this Project
Haunted Tools is a Barthesian mythology catalog examining forms that look like work but avoid transfers of budget, time, rights, or risk. Each tool is dissected using the semiotic scalpel: form, concept, twist.

**The 7 Barthesian Tools:**
1. **Makita Ethics Driver** — Ethics as calibration rather than structure
2. **Ryobi Access Drill Kit** — Access as aesthetic, not infrastructure
3. **DeWalt Citation Hammer** — Citation as blunt force
4. **Milwaukee Messiness Grinder** — Innovation as performance
5. **FLEXVOLT Justice Battery** — Capacity substitutes for connectivity
6. **Cordless Academic Drill** — Academic freedom becomes precarity
7. **Infinite Punch List** — Progress becomes permanent process

**Impetus & foundation.** This build is inspired by, and operationalizes ideas from:

- **Unboxing the Toolkit** — Shannon Mattern.
  A critical unpacking of what toolkits promise vs. what they deliver; this catalog responds by exposing the mythology embedded in tool-form itself.

- **Playing with Power Tools: Design Toolkits and the Framing of Equity** — Adrian Petterson, Keith Cheng, Priyank Chandra.
  How toolkits frame (and sometimes constrain) equity work; this project extends that critique to the broader category of "tools that look like tools."

**Week 5 readings:**
- Mattern, Shannon. "Unboxing the Toolkit." Toolshed, July 9, 2021. https://tool-shed.org/unboxing-the-toolkit/
- Petterson, Adrian, Keith Cheng, and Priyank Chandra. 2023. "Playing with Power Tools." CHI '23. doi:10.1145/3544548.3581490

**Method:** Semiotic Scalpel — form, concept, twist following Barthes' *Mythologies*

  How practitioners construct ethical identities; this deck makes those identity formations visible and explorable.

- **"Why Do We Do This?": Moral Stress and the Affective Experience of Ethics in Practice** — Sonja Rattay et al.
  The emotional labor of ethics work; this toolkit acknowledges the affective dimensions of practitioner roles.

- **Tactics of Soft Resistance in User Experience Professionals' Values Work** — Richmond Y. Wong.
  How UX professionals enact values work within constraints; this deck maps those tactical positions.

**Week 7 readings:**
- Chivukula, Shruthi Sai, et al. "Identity Claims That Underlie Ethical Awareness and Action." CHI '21. doi:10.1145/3411764.3445375

## func-sub (The Training Grounds)
**Weeks 11–14 — Project Workshopping**

### About this Project
The Training Grounds is a 6-axis spatial reasoning substrate for self-alignment and transformative clarity. Inspired by Jordan Caldwell's framework and Black Metal philosophy, it emphasizes intensity over comfort, clarity through noise, and catharsis as transformation.

**The Six Axes of Being:**
Every scene can be decomposed into 12 scalar measurements across six dual-polar axes:
1. **Identity** — Self ↔ Other
2. **Experience** — Comfort ↔ Challenge
3. **Language** — Explicit ↔ Implicit
4. **Domain** — Abstract ↔ Concrete
5. **Purpose** — Play ↔ Work
6. **Order** — Chaos ↔ Structure

**The Operator Triad:**
- **SHED** — Release what no longer serves
- **INTEGRATE** — Absorb what transforms
- **GROUND** — Anchor in embodied practice

**Impetus & foundation.** This build extends:

- **Holistic Security Toolkit** (Tactical Tech) — Self-care and security practices
