## 1. Describe Your Tool/Toolkit

**WAG: Words Assemble Geometries** is a suite of single-file HTML artifacts designed to support values and ethics work in technology design. The operative thesis: **Words don't just describe worlds—they compile them.**

The project emerged from a Freirean commitment: technology should be something you *wield*, not something that happens to you. We need design tools that democratize—not gatekeep—the power to construct possibility spaces.

The deployed interface lives at **[CORE-AGE](https://hartswf0.github.io/tractor-dce-gyo/)**, organized as:
- **Manifesto** — The thesis: LLM manages void, not scene
- **Playground** — Scenario Explorer with live generation
- **Toolkit** — Six interconnected tools
- **Cinema** — Video demonstrations
- **Research** — Collaborator work and academic grounding

All tools share an **invariant design pattern**: 9×9 grid interface, tetrad operators (Enhance/Obsolesce/Retrieve/Reverse), chat layer, phone-first constraint. This pattern emerged from TILTH's failure—a speculative company that collapsed under **complexity grey** (when broken and designed become indistinguishable).

| Tool | Function | Course Connection |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Thousand-Tetrad** | 9×9 scenario substrate | McLuhan's tetrad as prompt controller |
| **Privacy Value Labels** | 14-dimension CI worksheet | Mulligan/Koopman/Doty's privacy analytic |
| **Haunted Tools** | Mythology catalog (7 archetypes) | Mattern + Barthes |
| **Role Deck** | Ethical identity mapping | Wong's practitioner archetypes |
| **The Fork** | Negotiation training | Ethical frameworks as dialogic agents |
| **ONYX Studio** | Trail-aware operative workbench | Wong's infrastructure inversion |

**Core GPT Agents:**
- **Legos Cognitive Architect v8.0** — Words Assemble Grids, Geometries, and Generations
- **Le-Build-Build** — Translates ideas into optimized, build-ready MPD files

The unifying principle: **LLM manages void, not scene.** The LLM prepares empty structure (void) rather than constructing content (scene). Users fill the structure with their specifics. Complexity stays with the user who owns it.

## 2. What Issues Does It Address?

**The Complexity Spiral.** TILTH demonstrated the pathology: generative AI produces outputs faster than coherence can maintain them. World-building accumulates context until editing becomes impossible. The 9×9 substrate addresses this by providing **bounded complexity**—flatness as discipline, not poverty.

**The Export Problem.** Most LLM outputs are session-bound. They require the accumulated context of the conversation to make sense. When the session ends, they become artifacts without infrastructure. The shift to void management produces **exportable structures** (disc-data.json, POML files) that carry their logic with them, working without API access.

**The Toolkit Mythology.** Following Mattern's critique, **Haunted Tools** catalogs ethics tools that perform deliberation without transferring resources. The Deck transfers design time, not budget. The Audit captures liability, not harm reduction. The Dashboard shows what's measured, not what matters. Each operates through form/concept/twist: the form appears identical to the concept, occluding that nothing actually moved.

**The Disclosure Theatre.** Current AI disclosure frameworks assume scene-based use—discrete prompts yielding discrete outputs. Symbiotic use (150+ hours of embedded collaboration) doesn't itemize. The solution is trail visibility: architectures that make collaboration observable during work, not confessed afterward.

## 3. Who Are the Audiences?

**Primary: UX Researchers and Designers** working within organizational constraints, needing lightweight tools for values articulation that work on mobile phones, in meetings, during client consultations. Privacy Value Labels specifically targets this—14 dimensions of contextual integrity accessible in pocket.

**Secondary: Ethics Practitioners** navigating organizational power structures. Role Deck helps identify tactical positions within Bartle-taxonomy typologies: Achievers (metrics-driven, risk of optimization without reflection), Explorers (research-oriented, risk of perpetual research), Socializers (relation-building, risk of capture by powerful voices), Killers (adversarial, risk of marginalization). These are Wong's "soft resisters."

**Tertiary: Computational Humanities Researchers** interested in scenario-building substrates. Tested through collaborations with:
- **Tehri Marttila** (Portuguese computational humanities)—pushed toward open-source LLMs
- **Jordan Caldwell** (Black Metal philosophy)—6-axis Func-Sub framework
- **Kayla Uleah Evans** (Responsible AI Summit)—The Fork scenarios
- **Shuruq Tramontini** (procedurally generated emergent sims)—1000 Small Futures
- **So-youn (Soy) Jang** (moving through latent space without prompting)—alternative navigation

**Aspirational: Multi-Agent Narrative Systems Researchers.** I am not yet technical enough to engage with emergentic.ai or NeurIPS 2025 panelists. But I learned enormously about context engineering, ring buffer memory, and scene graph architecture.

## 4. Context of Use

**During design processes.** Privacy Value Labels maps information flows during UX research. The LEGOS framework (Location, Entities, Goals, Obstacles, Shifts) provides vocabulary for scenario articulation. Mobile-first means available *in the meeting*, not after.

**During organizational navigation.** Role Deck helps practitioners identify their game position. "We need more Socializers on this committee" becomes a legitimate coalition-building move.

**During collaborative speculation.** Thousand-Tetrad supports real-time scenario forking during workshops. Any state can fork; the substrate stays invariant. Tested extensively with Jordan, Kayla, and Tehri.

**During post-session sharing.** The shift from live LLM construction to prebaked formats (disc-data.json) enables outputs to be shared, critiqued, and built upon without API access. Export is the real problem; ONYX Studio addresses it.

## 5. Levers, Leverage Points, and Regulatory Modes

### Shilton's Values Levers

The toolkit creates **openings for values discussions** by:
- Making information flows visible (Privacy Value Labels surfaces 14 CI dimensions)
- Making ethical identities explorable (Role Deck maps practitioner archetypes)
- Making toolkit mythologies explicit (Haunted Tools provides form/concept/twist vocabulary)

### Meadows's Leverage Points (via Ehrlichman)

| Level | Type | Intervention |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 4 | Infrastructure | disc-data.json export format |
| 3 | Information Flows | Trail visibility; scenario exploration logs |
| 2 | Organizing Principles | 9×9 invariant grid; transfer audit requirement |
| **1** | **Mindsets** | **LLM manages void, not scene** |

The highest-leverage insight operates at Level 1: reframing AI creative tool design from "LLM constructs" to "LLM prepares, user instantiates." This preserves agency, reduces dependency, and enables export.

### Lessig's Regulatory Modes

**Liberty Machines** maps Law, Norms, Market, and Code as interactive forces, using the cigarette pack as case study in "freedom theatre." The key insight: **Architecture/code is as powerful as law**—often more powerful because invisible. The system prompt is constitutional design for AI collaboration.

## 6. Design/Creation Process

**Phase 0: TILTH — The Failure.** Built a speculative company to explore through generative accumulation. Failed due to complexity grey, coherency collapse, exponential context growth. What it taught: **build the key first**—better constraints produce better content.

**Phase 1: Thousand-Tetrad — The Discovery.** Recognized that better speculative worlds already existed (Ted Chiang, Life After Bob). Extracted tetrad controller mechanics and built an invariant substrate. Constraint: must work on phone. This alone eliminated most accumulated complexity.

**Phase 2: HOLO — The Transition.** Technical problems with live LLM scene construction pushed toward prebaked formats. The frustration with fine-grain control revealed the error: the LLM was supposed to manage the **void**, not the scene. Embedded narrative camera movement into disc-data.json.

**Phase 3: TRACTOR — The Synthesis.** Synthesized all components. The insight crystallized: **Before:** LLM manages scene → complexity → friction. **After:** LLM manages void → possibility space → user selects → agency preserved.

**Phase 4: Modulex/LEGO.** As complexity grew, adopted Modulex planning logic. Shifted documentation practice: every design decision visible as a brick. The 9×9 grid is a Modulex board; the tetrad operators are symbol vocabulary; the phone screen is bounded baseboard.

## 7. Learnings and Reflections

**On negative space programming.** The shape of the key determines what generation produces. Generative abundance must be disciplined by structural scarcity. Build the key first.

**On technical thresholds.** I am not yet technical enough for multi-agent systems work. But I learned: context engineering (structuring prompts, managing context windows), ring buffer memory systems (bounded persistent state), scene graph complexity (managing what the system remembers), linear algebra for 3D transformations.

**On collaboration without a platform.** Working with Kayla, Jordan, and Tehri taught me to "not try to act like I had a real platform." The better approach: produce documents and prompt guides, enable hands-on friction exposure, get out of the way to observe.

**On invariant patterns.** Design patterns that stay invariant across scenario-building scale better than patterns that accumulate context. The 9×9 grid + chat + tetrad + footer structure works for privacy, ethics, speculation alike.

**On export as the real problem.** The bigger issue than generation is export—how to produce artifacts from LLM collaboration that others can meaningfully engage with. ONYX Studio's structured output formats attempt this.

**On flatness.** Plancopy's commercial success came from *reducing* LEGO's geometric freedom, not expanding it. The project's viability came from the same reduction. **Flatness is not poverty. Flatness is discipline.**

## 8. Future Directions

1. **LDraw/LEGO integration** — Using real digital LEGO for scene construction; make outputs more specific than abstract geometries
2. **Open-source LLM adaptation** — Restructure for lower-cost models without API dependency
3. **Multi-agent architectures** — Moving toward Generative Agents model with persistent memory and social dynamics
4. **Physical artifacts** — Printed Haunted Tools and Role Deck cards for workshops
5. **POML development** — Expanding the prompt library into formal infrastructure for community registry
6. **Trail-aware tool ecosystem** — Position paper on observation vs. confession in disclosure policy

## Generative AI Statement

I used ChatGPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini as **embedded thought partners** across 150+ hours. The AI was not a discrete tool; it was a persistent interlocutor present in every design decision, code iteration, and conceptual refinement. The POML library (1,374 lines across 9 files) documents the prompt infrastructure developed—prompts that generate prompts, infrastructural rather than transactional.

The relationship resists itemization. This creates the double bind I examined in Disclosure Theatre: minimal disclosure misrepresents depth; full disclosure reads as dependency. The solution is trail visibility—architectures that make collaboration observable during work, not confessed afterward.
