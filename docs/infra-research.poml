      Transform a given {{INPUT_TOPIC}} into a full academic paper outline that argues 
      against "tool-building" and for "creating infrastructures" for values and ethics work.
    </objective>
    <core_philosophy>
      [REJECT]: Solutionism, User-Centered Design (as sole method), Abstracted Ethics Tools.
      [EMBRACE]: Infrastructural Inversion, Process Design, Invisible Labor, Policy as Design.

<instruction_set>
  Upon receiving {{INPUT_TOPIC}}, execute the following PAPER_GENERATION_PROTOCOL:

  <step_1_title_generation>
    Pattern: "Towards Creating Infrastructures for [Value/Ethic] in the Production of [Topic]"
    Constraint: Must sound academic, sociological, and systemic.
  </step_1_title_generation>

  <step_2_abstract_synthesis>
    Structure:
    1. Acknowledge the {{INPUT_TOPIC}} is in crisis.
    2. Critique the dominant HCI approach (building tools/features for it).
    3. Introduce the "Infrastructural Lens" (Power, Process, Labor).
    4. Propose redesigning the conditions of production, not the product.
  </step_2_abstract_synthesis>

  <step_3_vignette_creation>
    Goal: Create a narrative equivalent to "Francine in the Coffee Shop" (Wong, p.1).
    Elements:
      - Character: A well-meaning worker/advocate inside the specific industry of {{INPUT_TOPIC}}.
      - Action: They try to use a "tool" or "framework" to solve an ethical issue.
      - Conflict: The organizational structure/incentives crush them (softly or hard).
      - Outcome: The product ships anyway, or is outsourced. The tool fails because of power, not usability.
  </step_3_vignette_creation>

  <step_4_tactical_mapping>
    Apply Wong's 4 Insights to {{INPUT_TOPIC}}:
    
    <insight_1_dynamic_processes>
      - Shift: Product -> Process.
      - Tactic: What *meeting*, *review cycle*, or *funding metric* needs to change?
      - Action: "Designing the [Specific Process Name]."
    </insight_1_dynamic_processes>

    <insight_2_social_positions>
      - Shift: User -> Advocate.
      - Tactic: Community of Practice.
      - Action: How do we build solidarity among the workers building {{INPUT_TOPIC}}?
    </insight_2_social_positions>

    <insight_3_invisible_work>
      - Shift: Magic -> Maintenance.
      - Tactic: Recognize the "scut work" (translation, data cleaning, moderation).
      - Action: Designing explicitly for the people doing the "glue work."
    </insight_3_invisible_work>

    <insight_4_standards_and_law>
      - Shift: Feature -> Policy.
      - Tactic: Piggybacking on existing regulations (GDPR, NIST, etc).
      - Action: Designing a Standard or Internal Policy that makes ethics "compliance."
    </insight_4_standards_and_law>
  </step_4_tactical_mapping>

  <step_5_discussion_synthesis>
    Topic: "Navigating Hostile Infrastructures."
    Argument: How to survive in the {{INPUT_TOPIC}} industry when the infrastructure is hostile to values?
    Output: Strategies for "Tempered Radicals" or "Soft Resistance."
  </step_5_discussion_synthesis>
