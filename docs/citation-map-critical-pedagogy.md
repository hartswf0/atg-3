# Citation Map: Dialectics of the Digital Commons
## Placing 54 Sources on the Project Landscape

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Map critical pedagogy lineage from Freire to liberatory simulation

---

## THE BINDING THESIS

> "The tools of digital simulation—specifically game engines like Unity and social platforms like Roblox—are not merely neutral instruments of representation but are **active sites of pedagogical and political contestation**."

This paper provides the **emancipatory genealogy** for the project's interventions.

## CITATION → PROJECT MAPPING

### TIER 1: FREIREAN FOUNDATIONS

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 1, 2 | Freire / IEP | Conscientização, Banking Model | **Critical framework** | thesis foundation |
| 5, 6 | Pedagogy of Oppressed | Dialogic learning, Generative themes | **POML structure** | problem-posing |
| 8 | Critical Pedagogy of Place | Spatial turn | **intervention-atlas.html** | place-based |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "Praxis: reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it."

**This IS the project's methodology** — reflect on constraints, then implement POML operators to transform practice.

---

### TIER 2: CONSTRUCTIONISM (Papert → Maker Mindset)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 10 | FabLearn Fellows | Constructionism definition | **Making as learning** | Thousand-Tetrad |
| 10 | Papert/Piaget | Microworlds | **Bounded spaces** | void management |
| 11 | UNL Digital Commons | In-the-World frameworks | **Computational thinking** | pyramids |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "Papert argued that learning happens 'felicitously' when the learner is engaged in constructing a public entity."

**Thousand-Tetrad IS a public entity** — 67 scenarios made visible for critique.

---

### TIER 3: CRITICAL DIGITAL PEDAGOGY

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 12, 18 | Critical Digital Pedagogy | Interrogating the tool | **POML critique** | design principle |
| 14, 15 | Casey Reas / Kadenze | Software as culture | **Code as text** | creative coding |
| 16, 17 | p5.js / Aesthetic Programming | Inclusion, Pedagogy of care | **Accessible design** | ethics |
| 19 | Decoloniality in programming | Myth of axiological neutrality | **Critical code** | theory |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "A critical digital pedagogy asks not just 'how' to use a tool, but 'why' and 'whether' it should be used at all."

**This IS the stance toward AI tools** — interrogate, don't just adopt.

---

### TIER 4: SERIOUS TOYS (Eames → Sanchez)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 21, 22 | Eames Anthology | "Toys are preludes to serious ideas" | **Thousand-Tetrad** | LEGO connection |
| 28, 29 | Jose Sanchez / Plethora | Architecture for the Commons | **Anti-platform** | design philosophy |
| 30, 31, 32 | Block'hood | Ecological balance, entropy | **Systems thinking** | game mechanics |
| 33 | Common'hood | Mutual aid simulation | **Social dimensions** | intervention design |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "Toys are not as innocent as they look... Toys and games are the preludes to serious ideas." — Charles Eames (1958)

**This validates the entire LEGO → Modulex → Thousand-Tetrad lineage.**

---

### TIER 5: PLAYABLE CITY / COUNTER-TWINNING

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 37, 38 | Block by Block / Minecraft | Participatory planning | **Community design** | intervention model |
| 39, 40 | euPOLIS | Gamified Nature-Based Solutions | **Dialogic interface** | civic tech |
| 44, 45 | Counter-twinning Gothenburg | Qualitative data annotation | **wag-atlas.json** | alternative mapping |
| 46, 47, 48 | Playable City | Friction, spontaneity, human connection | **intervention-atlas** | anti-Smart City |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "While the Smart City prioritizes efficiency and seamlessness, the Playable City emphasizes friction, spontaneity, and human connection."

**The project IS Playable City thinking applied to AI tools.**

---

### TIER 6: CRITIQUE (Platform Capitalism)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 49, 50, 51 | Roblox critique | Surveillance capitalism, child labor | **Warning** | ethics |
| 52, 53, 54 | Próspera / ZEDEs | Neocolonial extraction, charter cities | **Counter-example** | critical theory |

**Key Quote to Place:**
> "The platform extracts value from their creativity while exposing them to 'surveillance capitalism' mechanisms."

**This is WHY the project uses open-source POML patterns, not proprietary platforms.**

## THE SERIOUS TOY COMPARATIVE TABLE

From the paper — maps project position:

| Platform | Mechanic | Freire Alignment | Project Parallel |
|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Block by Block** | Voxel construction | HIGH: Empowers marginalized voices | Community design model |
| **Block'hood** | Ecological balance | HIGH: Commons focus | Systems thinking |
| **euPOLIS** | NBS simulation | MEDIUM: Expert-citizen dialogue | Dialogic interface |
| **Roblox** | Open sandbox | MEDIUM (WARNING: surveillance) | Avoid this pattern |
| **Digital Twins** | Sensor data | LOW: Technocratic | Counter-twinning needed |
| **Thousand-Tetrad** | Scenario patterns | **HIGH: Named constraints** | **Project implementation** |

## WONG ↔ FREIRE CONNECTION

Wong's "Soft Resistance" (already in `citation-map-poml.md`) connects to Freire:

| Wong Tactic | Freire Concept | POML Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Creating space | Problem-posing | Modular `<task>` imports |
| Making visible | Conscientização | Explicit structure |
| Changing processes | Praxis | Version-controlled methodology |

**Wong operationalizes Freire for UX practice.**
**POML operationalizes Wong for AI prompting.**
