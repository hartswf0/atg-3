## Describe the Tool You Are Planning to Create

I am building an ecosystem of interconnected single-file HTML tools for values and ethics work, organized around an **invariant design pattern**: a 9×9 grid with tetrad operators (McLuhan's Enhance/Obsolesce/Retrieve/Reverse), chat-based natural language control, and scenario branching.

The central piece emerging is the **Thousand-Tetrad** engine—57 scenario analysis templates that can be applied to any domain. This week I completed the ring buffer fix that enables persistent state across analysis sessions.

The ecosystem connects:
- **Privacy Value Labels** (Week 3) → Contextual Integrity as worksheet
- **Haunted Tools** (Week 5) → Barthesian mythology catalog
- **Role Deck** (Week 7) → Ethical identity cards
- **Thousand-Tetrad** (Weeks 10+) → Scenario-building substrate

## What Progress Have You Made So Far?

### Completed (Weeks 1–7)

1. **dirty-disclosure** — Disclosure theatre interface demonstrating AI transparency double binds
2. **privacy-value-labels** — Mobile-first Contextual Integrity tool with 14 dimensions
3. **liberty-machines** — Interactive Lessig four modalities (Law/Norms/Market/Code)
4. **haunted-tools** — 7 Barthesian power tools exposed via semiotic scalpel
5. **role-deck** — Bartle taxonomy applied to ethics practitioners + FarmOS visualization

### In Progress (Weeks 10–11)

1. **1000-small-futures** — Tetrad analysis system with 57 scenarios
   - Ring buffer memory architecture ✓
   - Tetrad interface image ✓
   - OLOG #001 documentation ✓
   
2. **func-sub** — Training Grounds with Jordan Caldwell
   - t-series sonic explorations (t1, t4, t5, t7, t8) ✓
   - Black Metal as method documentation ✓
   - 6-axis spatial reasoning (starting)

3. **the-fork** — Research hub connecting projects
   - Initial structure ✓
   - Links to 1000 Small Futures, Func-Sub, Railway Game

## Challenges Faced So Far

### 1. The TILTH Failure
My earlier project (TILTH—a speculative company called Agronica) collapsed under its own complexity. As context accumulated, coherence became impossible. **Lesson learned**: Build invariant patterns that scale without accumulating context. Be parasitic off existing worlds rather than constructing new ones.

### 2. Disclosure Anxiety (The Sword of Damocles)
The more I use AI as a thought partner, the harder it becomes to report in ACM-style disclosure formats. This anxiety has hung over every assignment. I addressed it directly in dirty-disclosure, but it remains unresolved as an intellectual problem.

### 3. Collaboration Without a Platform
Working with Jordan and others, I've discovered I can't pretend to have a "real" platform. The better approach is producing documents, prompt guides, and hands-on friction exposure—then observing what happens.

---

## Feedback Requested

1. **On scope**: Am I trying to do too much? The ecosystem model feels right, but I'm uncertain whether a single "hub" tool (tractor) is the right synthesis, or whether the distributed repositories ARE the project.

2. **On leverage points**: I'm working primarily at Meadows's "Information Flows" and "Organizing Principles" levels. Am I missing opportunities at the "Mindsets" level?

3. **On collaboration documentation**: How much should I document the collaborator sessions (Jordan, Kayla, Tehri)? They're producing real friction and insight, but I don't want to over-report.

## Leverage Points Analysis (Ehrlichman/Meadows)

Following David Ehrlichman's synthesis of Donella Meadows's leverage points, here's where my tools operate:

### System Infrastructure (Low Leverage)
- **Not my focus**. I'm not changing constraints, rates, or buffers in existing systems.

### Information Flows (Medium Leverage)
- **Privacy Value Labels**: Makes CI dimensions visible during design
- **Haunted Tools**: Exposes mythological freight in institutional tools
- **Role Deck**: Makes ethical identity positions mappable

### Organizing Principles (High Leverage)
- **Thousand-Tetrad**: Changes the rules for how scenarios are built (invariant 9×9 grid)
- **Invariant substrate**: New organizational pattern that doesn't accumulate complexity
- **Trail-as-artifact**: What creators leave behind becomes first-class design material

### Mindsets (Highest Leverage)
- **dirty-disclosure**: Attempts to shift paradigm around AI transparency
- **LLM as void manager**: Reframes AI from scene constructor to possibility-space architect
- **Anti-tool philosophy**: Exposes operations instead of hiding them

Meadows wrote: "There's nothing necessarily physical, expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual, it can happen in a millisecond—all it takes is a click in the mind, an epiphany, a new way of seeing."

The project is betting on this. The tools don't just provide information; they try to induce paradigm clicks:
- *What if disclosure creates the problem it claims to solve?*
- *What if toolkits are mythology, not infrastructure?*
- *What if the LLM should manage void, not scene?*
