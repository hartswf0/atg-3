### TIER 2: MATERIAL PHYSICS (Maps to Grid/Constraints)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 18-19 | Hamel.dev — "Context Rot" | LLM performance degrades with context | **Scene Management pathology** | `grounded-theory-paper.md` |
| 20 | Anthropic — "Effective Context Engineering" | Attention Budget | **9×9 Grid constraint** | `thousand-tetrad.html` |
| 22-23 | Liu et al. — "Lost in the Middle" | U-shaped performance curve | **Position as Type** principle | `negative-space-pyramid.md` |
| 24 | Ms-PoE — Multi-scale Positional Encoding | Context refactoring | **Header/Grid/Chat/Footer** | design pattern |

**Integration Note:** These are EMPIRICAL sources that VALIDATE the grid constraint. ADD to Sinter Report pyramid.

---

### TIER 3: ACE FRAMEWORK (Maps to POML)

| # | Citation | Concept | Maps To | Project File |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| 36-41 | Stanford/SambaNova — ACE | Generator/Reflector/Curator | **POML Library structure** | `poml-library-pyramid.md` |

| 61 | Apidog — AI Agents from Scratch | Tool use = situated action | **67 scenarios** | `thousand-tetrad.html` |

**Integration Note:** Cheng's work IS narrative orchestration. These sources validate the framework.

## KEY QUOTE PLACEMENT

### Quote 1: The Material Turn
> "The context window has become the field of action where raw stochastic capability is transmuted into reliable, culturally aligned agentic behavior."

**Place in:** `void-management-thesis-paper.md` §1 Introduction

---

### Quote 2: Thick vs Thin
> "A model operating on 'thin' context processes tokens based on statistical likelihood without anchoring them in the deeper cultural or situational intent of the user. It sees the eyelid contract but cannot discern the conspiracy."

**Place in:** `context-as-material-pyramid.md` — Geertz section

---

### Quote 3: Situated Action
> "A model does not 'know' things in a vacuum; it 'knows' them only when they are situated within the active context window."

**Place in:** `trail-documentation-pyramid.md` — Suchman connection

---

### Quote 4: Material-Semiotics
> "The token—the fundamental atom of LLM processing—is a material-semiotic unit; it costs energy to process, occupies memory (KV cache), and carries semantic weight."

**Place in:** `context-as-material-pyramid.md` — Latour section

---

### Quote 5: Context Rot
> "As the volume of information in the window increases, the model's ability to accurately retrieve and reason about specific details degrades—a decay in the 'material integrity' of the context."

**Place in:** `sinter-report-pyramid.md` — CDS empirical validation

---

### Quote 6: Lost in the Middle
> "Models are highly effective at utilizing information at the beginning (primacy bias) and end (recency bias) of the context window but struggle significantly to access information buried in the middle."

**Place in:** `negative-space-pyramid.md` — position as type

---

### Quote 7: ACE Self-Baking
> "The agent 'bakes' raw, high-entropy interaction logs into durable, low-entropy knowledge that resides in the context window of future runs."

**Place in:** `poml-library-pyramid.md` — sinter pattern explanation

---

### Quote 8: The Era of the Context Architect
> "We are no longer just asking questions; we are building the 'webs of significance,' the 'situated environments,' and the 'living playbooks' that allow artificial minds to inhabit our world with thickness, nuance, and reliability."

**Place in:** `grounded-theory-paper.md` — Conclusion
