# Leverage Analysis
## WAG: Words Assemble Geometries — Strategic Intervention Points

*Applying Ehrlichman's leverage point framework across all artifacts, at multiple levels and time steps.*

---

## Meta-Rule

> **Think like Ehrlichman**: Find strategic acupuncture points in the system, then coordinate collective network action at the highest-leverage levels of rules and mindsets.

---

## Meadows's Leverage Hierarchy (Reference)

| Level | Type | Leverage | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **4** | System Infrastructure | Low | Constraints, rates, buffers |
| **3** | Information Flows | Medium | Feedback loops, communication systems |
| **2** | Organizing Principles | High | Rules, organization, goals |
| **1** | Mindsets | Highest | Paradigms, beliefs, transcendence |

## Project-Wide Leverage Map

### Where Are the Leverage Points in This System?

**Factors with many outgoing influences, few incoming:**

| Leverage Point | Outgoing Effects | Incoming Constraints | Intervention |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Invariant 9×9 grid** | Shapes all scenario tools, workshop exercises, exports | Minimal — self-imposed constraint | ✓ Already leveraged |
| **Trail-as-artifact thesis** | Changes documentation practice, disclosure approach, POML design | Academic conventions, ACM policies | Active intervention |
| **LLM-as-void-manager** | Restructures scene construction, export formats, user agency | Entrenched mental model (LLM constructs) | Key paradigm shift |
| **Single-file HTML philosophy** | Zero-dependency deployment, forkability, workshop portability | Web conventions, build-tool culture | Conscious resistance |

### Symptoms vs. Root Causes

| Symptom | Root Cause | Intervention Level |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Disclosure anxiety | ACM framework assumes transactional AI use | **Mindset** (paradigm shift needed) |
| Toolkit theatre | Ethics tools avoid real resource transfers | **Organizing Principles** (redesign what "tool" means) |
| Complexity spiral (TILTH) | Worlds accumulate context faster than coherence | **Information Flows** (bounded memory via ring buffer) |
| Export problem | LLM outputs ephemeral by default | **Infrastructure** (disc-data.json format) |

## Artifact-by-Artifact Leverage Analysis

---

### dirty-disclosure (Week 1)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | The ACM disclosure policy is a high-leverage rule—changing it would cascade through every academic submission. But unreachable directly. The accessible leverage: demonstrate the paradox so vividly that paradigms shift. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: students agonize over disclosure wording. Root: the framework assumes transactional AI (prompt→output), not symbiotic (embedded thought partner). Treating symptoms = better disclosure templates. Treating root = redefining what disclosure means. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Network of instructors + students + STS scholars who recognize the double bind → collective voice for policy reform. Could form a "Disclosure Theatre" working group. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | The Disclosure Theatre interface itself. High impact (exposes paradox), high doability (already built). Test: share with other LMC students, observe reactions. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current paradigm: disclosure = itemized confession. Target paradigm: disclosure = visible process. Condition for shift: tools that show trail during work, not after. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | Instructors don't see *how* students use AI, only what they report. If collaboration were visible throughout (like pair programming metrics), disclosure would be observation, not confession. |

**Time-Step Analysis:**

| Time | Intervention |
|------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Prototype exposes paradox (done) |
| Mid-semester | Articulate as intellectual problem (done) |
| End-semester | Write into submission as critical statement (done) |
| Future | Contribute to policy discourse? Publish? |

---

### privacy-value-labels (Week 3)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | Making CI dimensions visible during design meetings. If designers have this in their pocket, they ask different questions. Small shift (mobile access) → cascading effect (privacy considered earlier in process). |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: designers neglect privacy dimensions. Root: existing CI frameworks too academic, not portable. This tool treats root by making theory usable. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | UX researchers sharing dimension patterns across organizations → "common language" for privacy conversations. Network could establish dimension norms by domain. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | The mobile-first Label view. Test with UX practitioners during actual meetings. Track which dimensions get used, which get skipped. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: privacy as legal compliance checkbox. Target: privacy as design material (multi-dimensional, contextual). Condition: tools that make dimensionality tangible. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No feedback loop from actual data flows to stated intentions. Level 2 integration: observe what data actually moves, compare to what was intended. |

---

### liberty-machines (Week 4)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | Making regulatory modalities visible. Lessig's framework has few incoming (it's foundational theory) but many outgoing (shapes how we see code, law, markets, norms). Tool operationalizes this leverage. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: designers miss second-order effects (how code constrains future code). Root: modalities invisible. Tool makes forces tangible → designers think in systems. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Policy analysts + designers + legal scholars mapping real regulatory spaces together. Network sees whole system, not just their specialty. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | Cigarette pack case study. Generalizable template for any product under multi-modal regulation. Test: apply to AI regulation, see if useful. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: law as only regulation. Target: architecture/code as equally powerful. Condition: visceral experience of code-as-regulation. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | Real-time data on actual modality strengths (tax rates, platform policies, cultural norms) could pre-populate tool. Currently manual. |

---

### haunted-tools (Week 5)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | Institution's choice of which "ethics tools" to adopt. High leverage: a skeptical perspective on tools could prevent cargo-cult ethics before it spreads. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: ethics initiatives that don't change behavior. Root: tools selected for appearance, not transfer of budget/time/rights/risk. Catalog exposes this root. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | "Mythology watch" network: practitioners who spot and document new haunted tools as they emerge. Collective vigilance. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | The 7-tool catalog in print/web form. Test: use in workshop, ask participants to identify haunted tools in their own orgs. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: tools = good. Target: tools = potentially mythological. Condition: shared vocabulary for critique (form/concept/twist). |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No feed of newly-launched "ethics tools" to analyze. Community catalog with submissions would create this loop. |

---

### role-deck (Week 7)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | Practitioner's self-understanding. High leverage: if someone identifies as "Explorer" not "Achiever," their tactics shift. Small shift in identity → cascade of different actions. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: moral stress in practitioners. Root: mismatch between identity and organizational position. Cards help diagnose root (where do you sit? where do you want to be?). |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Network of ethics practitioners mapping collective positions. "We have too many Achievers, not enough Socializers"—strategic coalition-building. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | Physical cards for workshop use. Test: card-based activity in design ethics course. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: ethics as individual conscience. Target: ethics as strategic positioning within organizational game. Condition: seeing the game. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No organizational data feeding card positions. Level 2: cards connected to actual org maps. |

---

### 1000-small-futures (Weeks 10-14)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | The tetrad operators (Enhance/Obsolesce/Retrieve/Reverse). High leverage: any technology analyzed this way produces non-obvious insights. Framework with many outgoing effects. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: futures thinking that misses reversals. Root: linear extrapolation. Tetrad forces non-linear thinking by requiring "what flips at extremes?" |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Scenario analysts sharing tetrad analyses across domains. Network accumulates pattern library: "when X enhances Y, it often obsolesces Z." |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | 57-scenario library + ring buffer. Test: workshop participants fork scenarios, track which branches get explored. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: technology enhances. Target: technology simultaneously enhances, obsolesces, retrieves, reverses. Condition: habituated tetrad thinking. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No cross-user pattern visibility. Level 2: see what scenarios others explored, where collective attention clusters. |

---

### the-fork (Weeks 11-14)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | Treating moral frameworks as negotiating agents rather than decision algorithms. High leverage: reframes ethics from puzzle-solving to dialogue. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: ethical paralysis when frameworks conflict. Root: treating frameworks as answers rather than voices. Tool makes conflict productive. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Ethicists + domain experts + AI practitioners negotiating real dilemmas together. Each brings framework; tool structures dialogue. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | Railway Game with trolley problem variations. Test: Responsible AI workshop participants. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: ethics = find the right answer. Target: ethics = negotiate among valid perspectives. Condition: experience of productive conflict. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No history of past negotiations. Level 2: trail records how user mediated before, surfaces patterns and biases. |

---

### func-sub / Training Grounds (Weeks 11-14)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | The 6-axis framework creates a shared language for decomposing any scene. High leverage: once internalized, everything gets mapped to axes. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: self-help that doesn't ground. Root: no spatial/embodied framework. 6 axes provide substrate for self-alignment work. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Practitioners of different traditions (Black Metal philosophy, Holistic Security, etc.) mapping their methods onto shared axis system. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | t-series sonic explorations. Test: Jordan's workshop participants using the interface. |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: clarity through simplification. Target: clarity through noise (Black Metal principle). Condition: experience of catharsis-as-insight. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | Jordan's physical book format doesn't translate easily. Friction is the information: document what doesn't fit. |

---

### tractor-dce-gyo (Week 16)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | **LLM-as-void-manager** is the highest-leverage insight. Reframes entire AI creative tool design. Few incoming constraints (novel insight), many outgoing effects (restructures architecture, export, agency). |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: frustration with LLM scene construction. Root: wrong paradigm (LLM builds) instead of correct paradigm (LLM prepares, user chooses). |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | AI creative tool designers + simulation architects + ethicists sharing "void management" pattern. Network could establish design principles. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | ONYX Studio with disc-data.json export. Test: can someone without API access load and modify the scene? |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: LLM as generator. Target: LLM as void architect. Condition: tools that demonstrate the shift. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No visibility into how others use voids. Level 2: void usage patterns shared across users. |

---

### POML Library (9 files)

| Ehrlichman Question | Analysis |
|---------------------|----------|
| **p1: Leverage points** | The recursive.poml principle: prompts that generate prompts. Creates self-amplifying infrastructure. Highest leverage in the library. |
| **p2: Symptoms vs. roots** | Symptom: repeating similar prompts. Root: lack of abstraction layer. POML provides that layer—treat root, symptoms disappear. |
| **p3: Hi-fi collaboration** | Prompt engineers sharing POML library. Community curates, validates, extends. Network effect increases value. |
| **p4: Impact/Doability prototype** | prompt.poml (natural language → POML transformer). Test: can a colleague convert their prompts into POML using this? |
| **p5: Paradigm shift** | Current: prompts as ephemeral text. Target: prompts as structured, versionable, composable infrastructure. Condition: POML as standard. |
| **p6: Missing information flows** | No POML registry. No visibility into which POMLs others use, which patterns emerge. |

---

## Multi-Level Intervention Timeline

| Time | Infrastructure (Low) | Information Flows (Med) | Organizing Principles (High) | Mindsets (Highest) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Week 1** | — | — | — | Disclosure paradox exposed |
| **Week 3** | — | CI dimensions visible | Mobile-first constraint | Privacy as material (emerging) |
| **Week 4** | — | Modalities visible | Four-force framework | Regulation beyond law |
| **Week 5** | — | — | Semiotic scalpel method | Tools as mythology |
| **Week 7** | — | Identity positions visible | Bartle taxonomy for ethics | Ethics as positioning |
| **Weeks 10-14** | Ring buffer | Scenario exploration logs | 9×9 invariant grid | Bounded > unbounded |
| **Week 16** | disc-data.json export | Trail visibility | Trail-as-artifact | **LLM manages void** |
| **Future** | POML compiler | Cross-user patterns | POML as standard | Trail is design material |

---

## Highest-Leverage Interventions (Summary)

| Rank | Intervention | Level | Status | Next Step |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **LLM manages void, not scene** | Mindset | Validated | Document as design principle |
| 2 | **Trail-as-artifact** | Organizing Principle | Demonstrated | This very document |
| 3 | **Disclosure paradox** | Mindset | Articulated | Contribute to policy discourse |
| 4 | **Invariant 9×9 substrate** | Organizing Principle | Operational | Extend to more domains |
| 5 | **POML as infrastructure** | Information Flows | Documented | Build community/registry |
| 6 | **Semiotic scalpel method** | Information Flows | Catalogued | Community contributions |

---

## Collective Network Action Opportunities

Following Ehrlichman's emphasis on coordinated network impact:

| Opportunity | Network Actors | Leverage Point | Coordination Need |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Disclosure policy reform** | LMC students, STS scholars, instructors | ACM disclosure framework | Working group, position paper |
| **Trail-aware tool ecosystem** | AI/HCI researchers, tool designers | Tool architecture patterns | Design principles document |
| **POML registry** | Prompt engineers, LLM practitioners | Prompt infrastructure | Community platform |
| **Haunted Tools watch** | Ethics practitioners, org researchers | Institutional tool adoption | Submission/review system |
| **Tetrad pattern library** | Futures researchers, scenario planners | Technology analysis method | Shared database |

---

*"There's nothing necessarily physical, expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual, it can happen in a millisecond—all it takes is a click in the mind, an epiphany, a new way of seeing."*
— Donella Meadows

This project bets on paradigm clicks. The leverage analysis reveals where those clicks can cascade.

# Part II: Wong Infrastructure Inversion

## Meta-Rule

> **Think like Wong**: Invert the infrastructure to reveal hidden work, power asymmetries, and systemic constraints; redesign the sociotechnical conditions that make ethics possible rather than just the products.

---

## Project-Wide Infrastructure Inversion

### p1: Sociotechnical Infrastructures Shaping This Work

**Perform an infrastructural inversion—what background processes shape the foreground?**

| Infrastructure | Visible Effect | Hidden Constraint | Power Arrangement |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **GitHub Pages** | Free hosting for all tools | Tied to Microsoft/GitHub ecosystem; forces repo structure; analytics invisible | Platform shapes what "shareable" means |
| **LLM APIs** | Enables generation | API costs exclude some; rate limits constrain iteration; conversation logs owned by providers | Capital access determines participation |
| **Academic Course Structure** | Syllabus organizes work by weeks | Grades create disclosure anxiety; weekly deadlines force narrow scope; individual assessment conflicts with collaboration | Instructor has legibility power |
| **ACM Disclosure Policy** | Official transparency mandate | Assumes transactional AI use; penalizes symbiotic collaboration; forces post-hoc confession | Institution defines what counts as honest |
| **Single-File HTML Philosophy** | Zero dependencies | Self-imposed, but shaped by frustration with npm/webpack culture; reaction against infrastructure lock-in | Choosing autonomy over ecosystem benefits |

**Hidden infrastructure shaping TILTH failure:**
The speculative company (Agronica) failed because I was trying to build a *world* rather than work parasitically off existing worlds. The infrastructure of worldbuilding (wikis, lore documents, character sheets) accumulates context faster than any creator can maintain. The invisible constraint: *coherence scales worse than complexity*.

---

### p2: Invisible Labor

**Who performs the hidden work, and under what conditions of precarity?**

| Labor Type | Performed By | Conditions | Made Invisible How | Whose Benefit |
|------------|--------------|------------|--------------------| --------------|
| **Translation labor** | Watson (me) | Translating Jordan's physical book into digital; Tehri's ontology into interface | Appears as "single author" in commits | My grade; tool adoption |
| **Articulation labor** | Collaborators (Jordan, Kayla, Tehri) | Explaining their worlds to someone who can't fully absorb them | "Collaboration" credit obscures depth of effort | Project completion |
| **Emotional labor** | Me during disclosure anxiety | Managing the "sword of Damocles" feeling all semester | Final statement makes it visible, but only at end | ACM's appearance of transparency |
| **Prompt engineering labor** | Accumulated in POML library | 150+ hours of iteration, dead ends, frustrated rewrites | POMLs look "obvious" once finished | Future users get usable infrastructure |
| **Documentation labor** | This very document | Trail Map, Leverage Analysis, Olog structure | May be read as "self-promotional" rather than labor | Legibility to instructor, future self |

**Precarity analysis:**
- I'm a student, so my precarity is bounded (grades, not livelihood)
- Collaborators gave time with no grade incentive—purely relational
- The invisible labor of making AI collaboration look "legitimate" to ACM is unpaid and unrecognized

---

### p3: Positionality and Soft Resistance

**Who can advocate for change, and what tactics are being used?**

| Position | Power | Constraints | Soft Resistance Tactics |
|----------|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **PhD student in HCI** | Access to publication venues, academic legitimacy | Dependent on instructor approval, career trajectory concerns | Using course assignment as vehicle for critique (dirty-disclosure) |
| **White male in tech-adjacent field** | Taken seriously by default; less scrutiny on AI use | Responsibility to use position for critique, not just benefit | Naming the double bind publicly; documenting failure (TILTH) |
| **Collaborators without formal affiliation** | Free to experiment | No grade protection; no institutional legibility | Building their own worlds independent of my tools |
| **Tool users (hypothetical)** | Can fork and modify | Dependent on my documentation quality | Single-file philosophy explicitly enables departure |

**Soft resistance embedded in artifacts:**
- **dirty-disclosure**: Critique dressed as assignment submission
- **haunted-tools**: Skepticism dressed as catalog
- **Role Deck**: Exposing game-playing dressed as identity exercise
- **POML library**: Infrastructure for resistance (meta-prompts can be forked/modified)

---

### p4: Handholds for Values Advocates

**What standards or policies could be redesigned to create space?**

| Standard/Policy | Current Form | Redesign Handhold | Piggybacking Strategy |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **ACM Disclosure Policy** | Itemized, transactional | "Process documentation" option instead of confession | Connect to open science movement already pushing for transparency |
| **GitHub README conventions** | Technical focus | Creator Trail section as standard | Trail Map format could become convention |
| **Academic Integrity Policies** | Punitive, deceptive frame | Collaboration spectrum rather than binary | Connect to pair programming, acknowledged tutoring |
| **Ethics Tool Adoption** | Checkbox procurement | "Transfer audit" requirement (what resources actually move?) | Connect to existing audit/accountability movements |

**Handholds created by this project:**
- **POML schemas**: Provide structure for others to build on
- **Single-file philosophy**: Lowers barrier to modification
- **Trail Map format**: Template for self-documentation
- **Semiotic scalpel method**: Vocabulary for skeptical analysis

---

### p5: Market Logics and Capture

**How do business priorities capture or defang ethics efforts?**

| Market Logic | Capture Mechanism | Example in This Work | Resistance |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **API monetization** | LLM providers charge per token; constrains iteration | TRACTOR development limited by API costs; poorer researchers excluded | Void management reduces API calls; open-source LLM future direction |
| **Platform lock-in** | GitHub, Figma, Notion create dependencies | Tools built on GitHub Pages benefit from network effects but lock into ecosystem | Single-file HTML resists lock-in |
| **Attention economy** | "Engagement" metrics shape tool design | Temptation to add gamification, metrics | Explicit anti-engagement stance (no analytics in tools) |
| **Credentialism** | Academic career incentives shape what gets built | Pressure to produce "publishable" artifacts rather than useful ones | Course assignment as cover for building what's actually needed |
| **ESG/ethics washing** | Companies adopt cosmetic ethics | Haunted Tools documents this pattern | Vocabulary for critique (form/concept/twist) |

**Economic redesign possibilities:**
- **API cost sharing**: Networks pooling LLM access
- **Grant funding for infrastructure**: Not just papers, but tools
- **Credit for documentation labor**: Trail as first-class output

---

### p6: Communities of Practice

**What collective action sustains values work beyond individual heroics?**

| Community | Function | Current Status | Sustainability Need |
|-----------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **LMC-6650 cohort** | Shared context, peer review | Active this semester | Needs post-course structure |
| **Collaborator network** (Jordan, Kayla, Tehri, Shuruq) | Challenge and ground the work | Active but informal | Would need regular check-ins to persist |
| **STS/HCI research community** | Legitimacy, amplification | Potential but not engaged | Publication, conference participation |
| **Prompt engineering community** | POML adoption, extension | Does not exist formally | Registry, shared standards |
| **Ethics practitioners (Wong's "soft resisters")** | Real-world application | Imagined audience | Tools must reach them, not just researchers |

**Solidarity-building moves in this project:**
- **Crediting collaborators explicitly**: Jordan, Kayla, Tehri, Shuruq named
- **Documenting friction rather than success**: Shows real collaboration, not performance
- **Open-source philosophy**: Anyone can fork, modify, improve
- **Trail-as-artifact thesis**: Others' trails become designable

---

### p7: Lingua Franca and Embedded Values

**Whose expertise does this project legitimize?**

| Tool | Privileged Expertise | Embedded Values | Alternative Framings |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Privacy Value Labels** | UX design, CI theory | Information flows as designable; context as bounded | Could privilege legal (rights), anthropology (culture) |
| **Liberty Machines** | Legal/policy analysis | Four modalities as equal; architecture as regulation | Could privilege political science (institutions), economics (markets) |
| **Haunted Tools** | Semiotic/cultural theory | Mythology critique; skepticism of tools | Could privilege organizational behavior, management studies |
| **Role Deck** | Game design, Bartle taxonomy | Identity as position in game; tactics as legitimate | Could privilege psychology (personality), sociology (role theory) |
| **Thousand-Tetrad** | McLuhan, media ecology | Technology has laws; futures as tetrad-shaped | Could privilege foresight methods, scenario planning |
| **POML Library** | Prompt engineering, programming | Prompts as infrastructure; structure as value | Could privilege natural language, intuitive use |
| **This Documentation** | STS, infrastructure studies | Trail as first-class; documentation as labor | Could privilege traditional research formats |

**Self-critique:**
This project privileges:
- **Technical literacy**: Single-file HTML assumes some code comfort
- **Academic theory**: Barthes, Lessig, McLuhan, etc. embedded throughout
- **English language**: No translation, no multilingual consideration
- **Visual/text modes**: Low accessibility for screen readers, non-visual learners

**Redesign opportunity:**
Tools could be rebuilt to privilege different expertise—social workers, community organizers, non-technical practitioners. But this would require collaboration with those communities, not just building "for them."

## Artifact-by-Artifact Wong Analysis

---

### dirty-disclosure

| Wong Question | Deep Analysis |
|---------------|---------------|
| **p1: Infrastructure** | ACM policies + LLM conversation ephemerality + course grading structure create the double bind. The infrastructure *produces* disclosure anxiety; it's not individual neurosis. |
| **p2: Invisible labor** | The emotional labor of managing anxiety all semester. The translation labor of turning panic into intellectual problem. |
| **p3: Positionality** | I could build this because PhD student = some protection. An undergrad might not risk critique. |
| **p4: Handholds** | dirty-disclosure is itself a handhold—vocabulary for others to use when articulating the problem. |
| **p5: Market capture** | LLM providers benefit from disclosure anxiety because it increases "legitimate use" framing. |
| **p6: Community** | Needs a "disclosure reform" working group to have impact. |
| **p7: Lingua franca** | Privileges Bateson/double bind theory (psychology/systems), STS analysis. |

---

### haunted-tools

| Wong Question | Deep Analysis |
|---------------|---------------|
| **p1: Infrastructure** | Corporate ethics budgets, consulting industry, tool procurement processes create the mythology market. Tools get bought because they look like mitigation, not because they transfer risk. |
| **p2: Invisible labor** | The labor of skepticism is unpaid and often punished. Pointing out mythology makes you "cynical" or "difficult." |
| **p3: Positionality** | Junior employees can't call out haunted tools; doing so risks career. Safe critique requires position or exit. |
| **p4: Handholds** | form/concept/twist vocabulary provides handhold for skeptics to articulate concerns. |
| **p5: Market capture** | Ethics consulting is a market. Haunted tools are products. The critique itself could become product ("ironic ethics consulting"). |
| **p6: Community** | Needs "mythology watchers" network—people documenting new haunted tools as they emerge. |
| **p7: Lingua franca** | Privileges Barthes/semiotics (cultural theory). Could alienate those unfamiliar with mythology analysis. |

---

### role-deck

| Wong Question | Deep Analysis |
|---------------|---------------|
| **p1: Infrastructure** | Organizational hierarchies, performance reviews, job security create the positions practitioners occupy. Cards can map positions but can't change the structures producing them. |
| **p2: Invisible labor** | The soft resistance Wong describes—practitioners who quietly redirect resources, delay harmful projects, build coalitions—is unpaid and unrecognized. Cards make it visible but don't compensate it. |
| **p3: Positionality** | Achievers can advocate loudly; Explorers can experiment. Who can be a "Killer" (disrupt from within) depends on accumulated capital. |
| **p4: Handholds** | Cards provide vocabulary for coalition-building: "we need Socializers on this" is a legitimate move. |
| **p5: Market capture** | Ethics practitioner as individual hero serves corporate interests—keeps change personal, not structural. |
| **p6: Community** | Wong's research describes the community. Cards could become organizing tool for that community. |
| **p7: Lingua franca** | Privileges game design (Bartle), reduces ethics to tactics within existing rules. Doesn't question the game itself. |

---

### tractor-dce-gyo + POML Library

| Wong Question | Deep Analysis |
|---------------|---------------|
| **p1: Infrastructure** | LLM API economy, open-source culture, Git version control shape what "collaboration with AI" means. The infrastructure makes some collaborations visible (commits) and others invisible (conversations). |
| **p2: Invisible labor** | 150+ hours of prompt engineering labor is compressed into 9 POML files. The dead ends, frustrations, and iterations are invisible. This document partially surfaces them, but remains incomplete. |
| **p3: Positionality** | I could afford API costs (privilege). I had course structure (legitimacy). Others doing similar work may be invisible or excluded. |
| **p4: Handholds** | POML schemas provide handholds. Trail Map format provides handhold. Single-file philosophy provides handhold for departure. |
| **p5: Market capture** | LLM providers capture value from prompt engineering labor. POMLs could become products. Open-source license is partial resistance. |
| **p6: Community** | No POML community exists. Would need registry, shared standards, contribution norms. |
| **p7: Lingua franca** | Privileges programming/schema thinking. XML/JSON structure may alienate non-programmers. |

---

## Infrastructure Redesign Proposals

Following Wong's call to redesign sociotechnical conditions:

| Current Condition | Problem | Redesign Proposal |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Disclosure as post-hoc confession | Produces anxiety, misrepresents collaboration | Trail visible during work; disclosure as observation |
| Tool evaluation by appearance | Haunted tools proliferate | Transfer audit: what resources (budget/time/rights/risk) actually move? |
| Ethics work as individual heroics | Burnout, isolation, capture | Community structures, collective action, paid labor |
| LLM conversation ephemerality | Trail invisible, labor unrecognized | Persistent collaboration logs, user-controlled |
| Academic output as papers only | Documentation labor undervalued | Trail as first-class output, credited and cited |
| API access by payment only | Excludes researchers, reinforces inequality | Pooled access, academic discounts, open-source alternatives |

---

## Summary: Ehrlichman + Wong

| Framework | Question | Project Response |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Ehrlichman** | Where are leverage points? | 9×9 grid, void management, trail-as-artifact |
| **Ehrlichman** | Symptoms vs. roots? | Disclosure anxiety → ACM framework (root) |
| **Ehrlichman** | Hi-fi collaboration? | Network structures proposed (Disclosure Theatre working group, POML registry) |
| **Wong** | What infrastructure shapes this? | GitHub Pages, LLM APIs, course structure, ACM policy |
| **Wong** | Whose labor is invisible? | Translation, articulation, emotional, prompt engineering, documentation |
| **Wong** | Positionality? | PhD student = some protection; collaborators = relational investment |
| **Wong** | Market capture? | API monetization, ethics consulting market, credentialism |
| **Wong** | Lingua franca? | Privileges technical, theoretical, English-language expertise |

---

## The Honest Version

This project tries to redesign conditions for ethics work while remaining embedded in structures that constrain it:

- I'm still submitting to an instructor for a grade
- I'm still using Microsoft's GitHub, OpenAI's APIs
- I'm still privileging academic theory and technical form
- I'm still doing invisible labor and hoping it gets recognized

The tools expose contradictions they cannot resolve. The documentation makes labor visible without compensating it. The critique participates in what it critiques.

But: **the trail is now visible**. Future work can build from it—or depart from it—with more information than if it remained hidden.

That's the intervention: **legibility without confession, visibility without surveillance, infrastructure for resistance rather than capture**.
