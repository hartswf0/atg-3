    The Sustainability Institute.
https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/
```

**Citation:**
```
Meadows, D. (2008). Thinking in Systems: A Primer. Diana Wright (Ed.).

## ✅ NEW: CS THEORY / NSP FOUNDATIONS (December 10, 2025)

### Dijkstra — Go To Statement Considered Harmful
**STATUS:** ✅ VERIFIED — Structured programming origin

**Citation:**
```
Dijkstra, E. W. (1968). Go To Statement Considered Harmful.
    Communications of the ACM, 11(3), 147-148.
https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF
```

**Key Argument:** Unrestricted `goto` leads to "spaghetti code" — programs difficult to read, debug, verify. Structured control flow (sequence, selection, iteration) makes programs provable.

**Connection:** Early NSP — eliminating arbitrary jumps = eliminating invalid execution paths

### Hoare — Billion Dollar Mistake
**STATUS:** ✅ VERIFIED — Null reference critique

**Citation:**
```
Hoare, C. A. R. (2009). Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake.
    QCon London Keynote.
https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/
```

**Key Quote:** "I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965... This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes."

**Connection:** Null = representable invalid state. Modern languages (Rust, Swift) eliminate via Option types.

### Algebraic Data Types — Make Illegal States Unrepresentable
**STATUS:** ✅ VERIFIED — Type theory principle

**Citation:**
```
Functional Architecture. (n.d.). Make Illegal States Unrepresentable.
https://functional-architecture.org/patterns/make-illegal-states-unrepresentable/

Seemann, M. (n.d.). Types + Properties = Software: Designing with Types.
    ploeh blog.
https://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/11/28/easy-domain-modelling-with-types/
```

**Key Concept:** Sum types (OR) and product types (AND) encode domain constraints. Compiler enforces validity — illegal states cause compile-time errors, not runtime crashes.

**Connection:** CORE NSP principle — type system eliminates invalid state space

---

### Sum Types / Tagged Unions
**STATUS:** ✅ VERIFIED — ADT implementation

**Citation:**
```
Wikipedia. (n.d.). Algebraic data type.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type

    explained about functional programming.
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-data-types-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/
```

**Key Examples:**
- `Result<T, E>` = Success OR Error (not both)
- `Option<T>` = Some(value) OR None (eliminates null)
- `ConnectionState` = Connecting | Connected | Disconnected

**Connection:** State machines as types — invalid transitions unrepresentable

### LangSec — Language-Theoretic Security
**STATUS:** ✅ VERIFIED — Parser as security boundary

**Citation:**

    to "Weird Machines" and Theory of Computation.
;login: USENIX Magazine, 39(6).
```

**Key Concept:** "Recognize then validate" — input languages should be as simple as possible. Complex grammars = attack surface. Parser = security boundary.

**Connection:** Constraint design as security; simpler languages = smaller attack surface
