# The Practice of Generative Life: Tactics for Void Management

**A De Certeau Analysis of Constraint-Based Design**

---

## Calibration

### Definition (De Certeau's Terms)

> "A tactic is a calculated action determined by the absence of a proper locus... The space of a tactic is the space of the other. Thus it must play on and with a terrain imposed on it and organized by the law of a foreign power." \cite[p. 37]{decerteau1984practice}

**Strategy**: The calculus of power relationships that becomes possible when a subject of will and power (a corporation, a state, a platform) can be isolated from an "environment"—a place that can be delimited as its own.

**Tactic**: The art of the weak. It takes advantage of "opportunities" and depends on them, capturing them on the wing. It must vigilantly make use of the cracks that particular conjunctions open in the surveillance of proprietary powers.

### Priors: The Void as Strategic Space

The generative AI latent space—what we call "The Void"—is a **strategic terrain** par excellence. It is:
- **Owned**: By OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta
- **Mapped**: Through benchmarks, evaluations, red-teaming
- **Administered**: Through RLHF, Constitutional AI, guardrails
- **Monetized**: Through API access, token pricing, enterprise contracts

Users, workers, and designers operate **within** this strategic space. They have no "proper locus." They are tenants in someone else's possibility space.

**The question becomes**: What are the tactics available to those who dwell in the Void?

## Tactic Index: A Concordance for Generative Practice

### 1. LA PERRUQUE (The Wig / Worker's Own Work)

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "La perruque is the worker's own work disguised as work for his employer... using company time and materials to do 'work' for oneself." \cite[p. 25]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Workplace / Production
**Classification**: Exemplary
**Weight**: Central
**Confidence**: High

**Application to Generative AI**:

| La Perruque Tactic | Strategic Space Parasitized | Pyramid Connection |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Prompt-hacking on company time** | Corporate AI licenses | `paragon-essay-pyramid.md` |
| **Training personal models on employer compute** | Cloud infrastructure | `context-engineering-pyramid.md` |
| **Documenting failure modes for personal portfolio** | QA processes | `trail-documentation-pyramid.md` |
| **Building POML templates during "research"** | R&D budgets | `poml-library-pyramid.md` |

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Wong \cite{wong2021soft}: "UX professionals create space for ethics by reframing values work as 'knowledge sharing.'"
- Jackson \cite{jackson2014rethinking}: Repair work as legitimate labor

**Crack Exploited**: The gap between measured productivity (OKRs, sprint velocity) and actual practice.

---

### 2. TEXTUAL POACHING (Reading as Rewriting)

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "Reading is... a silent production... Readers are travellers; they move across lands belonging to someone else, like nomads poaching their way across fields they did not write." \cite[p. 174]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Textual / Consumption
**Classification**: Definitional
**Weight**: Central
**Confidence**: High

**Application to Generative AI**:

| Poaching Tactic | Strategic Text | Tactical Reappropriation |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Prompt injection** | System prompt | User inserts counter-instructions |
| **Jailbreaking** | Safety guidelines | User finds semantic gaps |
| **Context hijacking** | Conversation history | User steers toward unintended outputs |
| **Few-shot manipulation** | In-context examples | User trains model on-the-fly |

**Pyramid Connection**: `negative-space-pyramid.md` — These tactics exploit the representable invalid states that the strategy failed to close.

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Suchman \cite{suchman1987plans}: Plans are resources, not programs — the "reader" of a prompt is always rewriting it.
- Agre \cite{agre1997computation}: "Capture" attempts to fix meaning, but reading escapes.

**Paradox**: Jailbreaking is simultaneously celebrated (user empowerment) and pathologized (misuse). De Certeau would note that **the tactic is always already inside the system it parasitizes**.

---

### 3. WALKING IN THE CITY (Spatial Practice / Desire Paths)

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "The act of walking is to the urban system what the speech act is to language... The walker transforms each spatial signifier into something else." \cite[p. 98]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Urban / Spatial
**Classification**: Metaphor
**Weight**: Central
**Confidence**: High

**Application to Generative AI**:

The "city" is the **interface**. The gridded streets are the **UI patterns**. The walker's path is the **user's actual session**.

| Spatial Tactic | Interface Strategy | Desire Path |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Workflow hacks** | Designed user journey | User finds shortcuts |
| **API abuse** | Rate limits, TOS | User scripts around constraints |
| **Context window stuffing** | Token limits | User compresses, abbreviates |
| **Multi-model routing** | Vendor lock-in | User chains models tactically |

**Pyramid Connection**: `digital-lego-ecosystem-pyramid.md` — The LDraw community's 27-year maintenance of unofficial parts is a collective desire path through LEGO's proprietary system.

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Chalmers \cite{chalmers2003seamful}: Seamful design exposes the "cracks" that enable tactical navigation.
- Scott \cite{scott1998seeing}: "Métis" (local knowledge) navigates what "techne" (state knowledge) cannot see.

### 4. MAKING DO / BRICOLAGE

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "Making do—making use of the imposed constraints to create something new... bricolage, an artisan-like inventiveness." \cite[p. 18]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Consumption / Production
**Classification**: Exemplary
**Weight**: Central
**Confidence**: High

**Application to Generative AI**:

| Bricolage Tactic | Materials at Hand | Improvised Artifact |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **POML operators** | XML tags, markdown | Structured prompt system |
| **Thousand-Tetrad** | Scenario patterns | 67 constraint templates |
| **Context sintering** | Accumulated history | Curated, compressed context |
| **Guardrail surfing** | Safety boundaries | Creative constraint exploitation |

**Pyramid Connection**: `sinter-report-pyramid.md` — Sintering IS bricolage. It takes the granular material (context) and consolidates it without industrial equipment (fine-tuning).

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Eames \cite{eames1958toys}: "Toys are preludes to serious ideas" — serious play as bricolage.
- Papert \cite{papert1980mindstorms}: Constructionism as making-do with computational materials.
- Sanchez \cite{sanchez2019architecture}: Architecture for the Commons as collective bricolage.

### 5. THE ART OF MEMORY (Mnemotechnics)

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "Memory is... a sense of the other, an anti-museum... Memory is played by circumstances, the way a piano is played by someone." \cite[p. 86-87]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Temporal / Cognitive
**Classification**: Definitional
**Weight**: Moderate
**Confidence**: Med

**Application to Generative AI**:

The **context window** is the AI's "memory." But it is **strategic memory**—owned, administered, priced by token.

Tactical memory practices include:

| Memory Tactic | Strategic Memory | Tactical Counter |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Summarization hacks** | Token limits | User compresses dialogue |
| **Memory anchoring** | Session reset | User repeats key phrases |
| **External context storage** | Ephemeral sessions | User maintains notes file |
| **Persona persistence** | Stateless API | User includes persona in each call |

**Pyramid Connection**: `context-engineering-pyramid.md` — LangChain's "Generator-Reflector-Curator" pattern is a formalization of tactical memory.

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Miller \cite{miller1956magical}: The 7±2 limit makes memory a scarce resource to be tactically managed.
- Cogworkspace \cite{cogworkspace2025}: "Active Memory Management" as working memory vs. long-term storage.

### 6. LA RUSE (Cunning / Mētis)

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "The Greeks called it mētis... the intelligence of cunning, that turns power against itself... the very quintessence of the tactic." \cite[p. 81]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Strategic / Meta
**Classification**: Definitional
**Weight**: Central
**Confidence**: High

**Application to Generative AI**:

Mētis is the meta-tactic: using the system's own rules against it.

| Mētis Tactic | System Rule Exploited | Judo Move |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Red-teaming as cover** | Safety research | Legitimate jailbreaking |
| **Compliance as trojan** | Regulations (EU AI Act) | Ethics-as-compliance |
| **Open-source as escape** | Proprietary lock-in | Llama, Mistral, etc. |
| **Academic framing** | Publishing norms | Research legitimates critique |

**Pyramid Connection**: `leverage-analysis-pyramid.md` — Meadows' highest leverage point is "power to transcend paradigms"—the ultimate mētis.

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Scott \cite{scott1998seeing}: "Mētis is the practical knowledge that evades simplifying schemata."
- Wong \cite{wong2021soft}: "Soft resistance uses the language and tools of the organization against its own worst tendencies."
- Lessig \cite{lessig2006code}: "Code is law"—but law can be rewritten by those who understand code.

### 7. CONSUMER RESISTANCE (The Uses of Commodities)

**De Certeau Definition**:
> "Marginality is becoming universal. A marginal group has now become a silent majority... the consumer is a producer of meanings." \cite[p. xvii]{decerteau1984practice}

**Mode**: Consumption / Market
**Classification**: Exemplary
**Weight**: Moderate
**Confidence**: High

**Application to Generative AI**:

AI is sold as a product. But "consumption" is never passive.

| Consumer Tactic | Product Strategy | Use Against Intent |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Free tier abuse** | Freemium model | Max value at $0 |
| **API pooling** | Per-seat pricing | Shared accounts |
| **Output laundering** | License restrictions | Claim human authorship |
| **Model distillation** | Proprietary weights | Train on outputs |

**Pyramid Connection**: `digital-lego-ecosystem-pyramid.md` — BrickLink community "consumes" LEGO by building an entire aftermarket ecosystem.

**BibTeX Grounding**:
- Sanchez \cite{sanchez2019architecture}: "Architecture for the Commons" resists platform extraction.
- Freire \cite{freire1970pedagogy}: "Banking model" treats learners as consumers; problem-posing resists.

## Meta-Theory of Tactics (Core Claims)

Drawing across De Certeau and our bibliography:

1. **Tactics have no "proper place"** — They operate in the space of the other (the platform, the employer, the model provider).

2. **Tactics are time-bound** — They seize opportunities; they cannot stockpile gains. Each prompt is a new negotiation.

3. **Tactics produce no lasting monument** — They leave traces (chat logs, fine-tunes) but these can be erased, deprecated, rate-limited.

4. **Tactics are mētis, not logos** — They are cunning, not rational planning. They require "touch," not "method."

5. **Tactics parasitize strategy** — They do not destroy the host; they dwell within it. Jailbreaking requires the jail.

6. **Tactics are invisible to metrics** — OKRs, benchmarks, and evaluations measure strategic outputs, not tactical ingenuity.

7. **Tactics spread epidemically** — One discovered prompt injection becomes a template, a meme, a Discord channel.

8. **Tactics are morally ambiguous** — The same move is "creative use" or "misuse" depending on who names it.

9. **Tactics are recuperable** — Platforms study tactics and close the cracks. But new cracks open.

10. **The tactic/strategy distinction is not fixed** — Workers organized become unions; bricoleurs become studios; poachers become publishers.

### Top 5 Paradoxes

1. Tactics depend on the strategy they resist
2. Tactics are invisible to the metrics that govern them
3. Tactics spread epidemically but cannot be institutionalized
4. The same act is "creative" or "misuse" depending on who names it
5. Recuperation closes cracks but opens new ones

### Top 5 Strategy Interfaces

1. System prompt ↔ Prompt injection
2. RLHF ↔ Jailbreaking
3. Proprietary access ↔ Open-source escape
4. Employment contract ↔ La perruque
5. Context window ↔ Memory hacking

### Live Question De Certeau Leaves Open

> **Can tactics ever transform into strategy without losing their tactical character?**

Applied to Void Management: Can a collection of POML operators, sintering practices, and community formations ever constitute an "infrastructure" without becoming the new surveilled space? Can the Prompt Engineering Guild avoid becoming FAANG's ethics-washing department?

This is the question Wong \cite{wong2021soft} inherits: **the tempered radical's dilemma**.

## Conclusion: The Topology of Tactics

De Certeau's framework reveals that Void Management is not a **strategy**—it is a **repertoire of tactics** for those who dwell in spaces they do not own.

The pyramids document these tactics:
- `sinter-report-pyramid.md` = Bricolage
- `poml-library-pyramid.md` = Making-do
- `context-engineering-pyramid.md` = Memory art
- `negative-space-pyramid.md` = Crack exploitation
- `leverage-analysis-pyramid.md` = Mētis
- `digital-lego-ecosystem-pyramid.md` = Consumer resistance
- `trail-documentation-pyramid.md` = Trace inscription

The thesis is: **You cannot own the Void. But you can dwell tactically within it.**

Or, in De Certeau's terms:

> "Everyday life invents itself by poaching in countless ways on the property of others."
