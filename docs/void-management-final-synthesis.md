## EXTENDED ABSTRACT (300 words)

**TITLE:** Void Management: A Theoretical Framework for Context Engineering in LLM-Assisted Creative Systems

Generative AI systems increasingly support iterative creative work, yet their collaboration patterns remain poorly theorized. We introduce *void management*, an architectural framework that distinguishes two paradigms: *scene management*, where LLMs construct cumulative content requiring full context to modify, and *void management*, where LLMs prepare bounded possibility spaces that users instantiate.

Our distinction emerges from a 45-year intellectual trajectory: from Suchman's critique of planning models (1987), through Scott's analysis of legibility (1998), to Lessig's architectural regulation (1999), and into contemporary context engineering practice (Karpathy, 2025). We ground the thesis in five theoretical traditions: complexity theory (Simon, Brooks), situated action (Suchman, Agre), cognitive science (Sweller, Cowan), human-centered AI (Shneiderman, Amershi), and infrastructure studies (Bowker, Star, Latour).

The thesis explains recent empirical discoveries: many-shot in-context learning works because it "terraforms" the void with examples; cognitive workspaces help because they prevent scene accumulation; seamful XAI succeeds because it makes the void visible; infinite canvases outperform chat because they spatialize possibility spaces.

Through 150+ hours of design research, we developed POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language), a 1,300+ line prompt library embodying void management principles. We demonstrate the framework across 10 design interventions, from speculative fiction to ethics tools. Evidence includes failure-success pairs: TILTH (scene management) collapsed after 8 modifications; Thousand-Tetrad (void management) sustained 40+ iterations.

The thesis is falsifiable: scene-managed systems maintaining >20 modifications without coherence collapse would refute it. We contribute: (1) the void/scene distinction as analytical vocabulary, (2) a mechanism explaining context degradation, (3) architectural principles for context engineering practice, and (4) exportable void structures as proof of concept.

**KEYWORDS:** Context Engineering, Human-AI Collaboration, LLM, Bounded Rationality, Situated Action, HCAI, Prompt Architecture

## RELATED WORK (1200 words)

### 2.1 Complexity and Bounded Rationality

The intellectual foundations of void management lie in Simon's complexity theory. Simon (1962) introduced "near-decomposable" systems—complex wholes amenable to hierarchical understanding. Brooks (1987) extended this to software, distinguishing *essential* complexity (inherent to the problem) from *accidental* complexity (introduced by solutions).

Our void/scene distinction operationalizes this framework. Scene management accumulates both essential and accidental complexity: each LLM response adds context that subsequent responses must account for, producing non-decomposable structures. Void management bounds accidental complexity by fixing the dimensions of possibility space while leaving instantiation to users. The void is near-decomposable by design; the scene becomes non-decomposable through accumulation.

Cognitive load theory provides the psychological mechanism. Sweller (1988) distinguished intrinsic load (problem difficulty), extraneous load (presentation overhead), and germane load (learning effort). Miller (1956) and Cowan (2001) established bounded working memory capacity. When extraneous load—the overhead of tracking accumulated context—exceeds capacity, users enter what we call "complexity grey": the state where distinguishing broken from designed becomes impossible.

### 2.2 Situated Action and Representation

The situated action tradition critiques systems that maintain complete world models. Suchman (1987) argued that plans are "resources for action, not its determinants"—guides that enable improvisation rather than scripts that determine outcomes. This directly anticipates the failure of scene management: a complete scene is a failed plan, overwhelmed by circumstances it cannot anticipate.

Agre (1997) sharpened this with his distinction between *deictic* and *indexical* representations. Deictic approaches maintain absolute world models ("the red block on the blue block"); indexical approaches maintain only relative references ("this block on that"). Deictic systems fail to scale because they require complete state maintenance; indexical systems scale because they require only local context.

This distinction IS the void/scene distinction:

| Agre (1997) | Void Management Thesis |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Deictic representation | Scene (cumulative state) |
| Indexical representation | Void (bounded dimensions) |
| Deictics fail to scale | Scenes collapse under iteration |
| Indexicals enable situated action | Voids enable instantiation |

Winograd & Flores (1987) introduced the Heideggerian concept of *breakdown*—the moment tools become visible. Recent work identifies generative AI interaction as "permanent breakdown" or "ontological drift." Void management productively embraces breakdown: the void's dimensions are always visible, always navigable as discrete structure rather than transparent medium.

Dourish (2001) argued that context is "achieved, not observed"—actively constructed through interaction rather than passively recorded. Scene management treats context as container (accumulated tokens); void management treats context as achievement (user instantiation within bounded space). This aligns with Haraway's (1988) situated knowledges: the void makes position explicit, rejecting the "view from nowhere" that scene management implicitly assumes.

### 2.3 Infrastructure and Legibility

The infrastructure studies tradition illuminates how void management makes invisible structures visible. Bowker and Star (1999) proposed *infrastructural inversion*: making background systems foreground so their embedded values become examinable. Scene management black-boxes AI contribution; void management performs infrastructural inversion, exposing prompt architecture for examination.

Scott (1998) analyzed state "legibility" projects: simplifications that make complex realities administratively tractable but destroy local knowledge (*mētis*). In LLM interaction, context engineering makes human intent legible to "the alien ontology of the model." But scene management reproduces high-modernist failure: like Soviet agricultural collectivization, it imposes universal schemas that destroy situated intelligence. Void management preserves mētis by bounding dimensions while leaving instantiation to human judgment.

Latour (1987, 2005) contributed *inscription* (durable traces) and *black-boxing* (rendering technical content invisible). The void is both inscription device (creating durable structures like POML files) and anti-black-box (keeping seams visible). Exported void structures (disc-data.json, scene templates) are "immutable mobiles"—artifacts that travel without distortion.

### 2.4 Human-Centered AI

Contemporary HCAI frameworks provide design criteria. Horvitz (1999) established mixed-initiative principles for human-AI handoff. Amershi et al. (2019) validated 18 guidelines including "make clear what the system can do" and "make clear why the system did what it did." Shneiderman (2022) proposed a two-dimensional framework: ideal systems achieve both high control and high automation.

Our contribution is *architectural mechanism*. Guidelines describe WHAT (high control, transparency); void management provides HOW. The void's dimensions are explicit (transparency); instantiation is human (control); LLM prepares the void (automation). This is HCAI implemented as system architecture.

### 2.5 Context Engineering (Contemporary)

The practice of context engineering has been named but not theorized. Karpathy (2025) coined the term: "context engineering" over "prompt engineering" to emphasize architectural curation of the context window. Willison (2025) elaborated components: system prompts, retrieved content, conversation history, tool outputs, structured data.

Empirical discoveries validate void management's predictions. Many-shot in-context learning (Anthropic, 2024) works by "terraforming" the probability space with examples—populating the void with instantiation templates. Cognitive workspaces (2024-2025) prevent scene accumulation through active memory management. Process alignment (Terry et al., 2025) makes reasoning seams visible—void architecture exposed for verification.

Seamful XAI (Ehsan et al., 2024) argues against hiding AI limitations (seamlessness) in favor of strategic exposure (seamfulness). This IS void management: the void's bounds are purposively visible seams where users "sinter" their intent into model capability gaps. Spatial architectures (DeckFlow, PromptCanvas) abandon linear chat for "infinite canvas" visualization—possibility spaces made navigable as cards and widgets.

Chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and its variants (zero-shot CoT, tree-of-thoughts, least-to-most) are proto-void management: each constrains the reasoning process without specifying content, defining void dimensions through structural instructions. Our POML formalizes what these techniques discovered empirically.

## CONTRIBUTIONS (400 words)

### Contribution 1: CONCEPTUAL — The Void/Scene Distinction

We introduce the distinction between *scene* (cumulative state requiring full context to modify) and *void* (bounded possibility space with fixed dimensions and variable instantiations). This provides vocabulary lacking in prior work for analyzing iterative LLM collaboration.

*Prior work lacks:* A clear conceptual framework for long-context AI collaboration patterns.
*This thesis provides:* The void/scene distinction as analytical tool and design heuristic.

### Contribution 2: MECHANISTIC — Explaining Context Degradation

We explain WHY context degradation occurs (complexity accumulates faster than coherence) and WHEN it triggers (extraneous cognitive load exceeds bounded capacity). This connects empirical observations—Howard's "Context Degradation Syndrome" (2024), Anthropic's "context rot"—to theoretical mechanism.

*Prior work documents:* Context degradation as observed phenomenon.
*This thesis explains:* The mechanism (scene management) and solution (void management).

### Contribution 3: HISTORICAL — The Genealogical Arc

We trace context engineering from archival foundations (Suchman, Scott, Lessig) through the material turn (many-shot, cognitive workspaces) to spatial architectures (DeckFlow, PromptCanvas). This 45-year trajectory legitimizes the thesis as continuation of established intellectual projects.

*Prior work treats:* Context engineering as novel practice.
*This thesis shows:* Context engineering as modern realization of situated action and legibility projects.

### Contribution 4: PRACTICAL — Architectural Principles

We provide design principles derived from theory:
1. Define dimensions, not content
2. Bound the possibility space
3. Let users instantiate
4. Make constraints explicit (seamful)
5. Enable export (immutable mobiles)

*Prior work offers:* Ad-hoc prompting techniques discovered empirically.
*This thesis offers:* Principled architecture grounded in five theoretical traditions.

### Contribution 5: ARTIFACT — POML and Exportable Structures

We contribute concrete implementations: POML (1,300+ lines of prompt infrastructure) and exportable void structures (disc-data.json, scene templates). These demonstrate that void management is not speculative but implementable.

*Prior work produces:* Session-bound outputs that die with the conversation.
*This thesis produces:* Exportable, reusable void architecture that travels independently.

## FALSIFIABILITY

The thesis is falsifiable. Specifically:

> **Refutation condition:** A scene-managed system demonstrating >20 iterative modifications without coherence collapse would refute the central claim.

"Coherence collapse" is operationally defined as: modifying element X causes unintended changes to >3 other elements (Y, Z, W...). "Scene management" is operationally defined as: conversational LLM interface with full history visible, no explicit dimensional constraints.

Evidence to date supports the thesis. TILTH (scene management) collapsed at modification 8; Thousand-Tetrad (void management) sustained 40+ modifications. Context degradation syndrome confirms the mechanism. But the claim remains empirically vulnerable—exactly as scientific claims should be.
