# LMC-6650 Final Writeup: Deep Grounded Responses

## The Questions (with Repo-Grounded Answers)

---

## 1. Describe Your Tool/Toolkit

**The Short Answer:** WAG (Words Assemble Geometries) is an ecosystem of single-file HTML artifacts for values and ethics work in technology design. The operative thesis: *Words don't just describe worlds—they compile them.*

**The Deeper Answer:**

The toolkit is built on a discovery that emerged from failure. TILTH was a speculative company (Agronica) meant to explore ethical operating systems through generative accumulation. It collapsed under what the project calls **complexity grey**—the zone where brokenness and design become indistinguishable. The system's liability exceeded its asset value. Each addition made the whole harder to maintain.

From that failure emerged an invariant pattern:

> "The shape of the key determines what the generation produces. Build the key first."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

The invariant pattern: **9×9 grid + tetrad operators (Enhance/Obsolesce/Retrieve/Reverse) + chat layer + branching mechanics**. This pattern scales across any scenario while remaining inspectable at any moment.

The theoretical grounding comes from Wallace Stevens' "Anecdote of the Jar":

> "I placed a jar in Tennessee / And round it was, upon a hill. / It made the slovenly wilderness / Surround that hill."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

The jar is the void. It doesn't fill the wilderness—it **organizes** it. The toolkit provides bounded structures that make unbounded environments sensible.

The tools include:
- **Privacy Value Labels**: 14-dimension Contextual Integrity worksheet (Mulligan/Koopman/Doty)
- **Haunted Tools**: Barthesian mythology catalog of ethics tools that perform deliberation without transferring resources
- **Thousand-Tetrad**: McLuhan's tetrad as prompt controllers across 67 scenario templates
- **Role Deck**: Bartle-taxonomy identity mapping for ethics practitioners
- **ONYX Studio**: Trail-aware operative workbench producing shareable artifacts without API access

The unifying insight: **LLM manages void, not scene.** The LLM prepares empty structure; users fill it with their specifics. Complexity stays with the user who owns it.

## 2. What Issues Does the Toolkit Address?

**Issue 1: The Complexity Spiral**

> "Scene management fails because its cognitive cost grows unboundedly. Void management succeeds because bounded structures cannot accumulate unbounded context."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

TILTH demonstrated this pathology firsthand. Generative AI produces outputs faster than coherence can maintain them. The 9×9 grid addresses this by providing **bounded complexity**—flatness as discipline, not poverty.

**Issue 2: The Export Problem**

Most LLM outputs are session-bound. They require accumulated context to make sense. When the session ends, they become artifacts without infrastructure. The shift to void management produces **exportable structures** (disc-data.json, POML files) that carry their logic with them, working without API access.

> "The bigger issue than generation is export—how to produce artifacts from LLM collaboration that others can meaningfully engage with."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

**Issue 3: The Toolkit Mythology (Haunted Tools)**

> "Every ethics toolkit launched this decade shares a common pathology: the more it claims to solve, the less it transfers. Card decks perform deliberation without allocating budget. Audits capture liability without reducing harm. Dashboards display metrics without enabling intervention. These are *haunted tools*—artifacts where form occludes function."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

Following Barthes' mythology, haunted tools operate through three layers: **form** (what it looks like), **concept** (what it claims to do), and **twist** (what it actually transfers). The Deck transfers design time, not budget. The Audit captures liability, not harm reduction. Trail visibility is the antidote—architectures that document what actually moved.

**Issue 4: Disclosure Theatre**

> "The ACM's disclosure framework asks authors to specify which sections were created by generative AI... This assumes a model of AI use where a human writes a prompt, receives output, and decides to keep or edit it—a discrete, transactional relationship. My use of generative AI this semester does not fit this model."
> — *final-project-writeup.md*

The solution: **trail visibility**—architectures that make collaboration observable during work, not confessed afterward.

## 3. Who Are the Audiences?

**Primary: UX Researchers and Designers** working within organizational constraints, needing lightweight tools for values articulation that work on mobile phones, in meetings, during client consultations. Privacy Value Labels specifically targets this—14 dimensions of contextual integrity accessible in pocket.

**Secondary: Ethics Practitioners (Wong's "Soft Resisters")** navigating organizational power structures. Role Deck maps Bartle-taxonomy positions:
- **Achievers**: Metrics-driven (risk: optimization without reflection)
- **Explorers**: Research-oriented (risk: perpetual research)
- **Socializers**: Relation-building (risk: capture by powerful voices)
- **Killers**: Adversarial (risk: marginalization)

**Tertiary: Computational Humanities Researchers** tested through collaborations:
- **Tehri Marttila**: Pushed toward open-source LLMs, built collaborative branching paths
- **Jordan Caldwell**: "Black Metal" speculative worldbuilding
- **Kayla Uleah Evans**: Ethical negotiation training (The Fork)
- **Shuruq Tramontini**: 1000 Lives bounded futures (opposite of TILTH)

**Aspirational: Multi-Agent Narrative Systems Researchers** (NeurIPS Emergent Stories panelists). Not yet technical enough to engage—but learned context engineering, ring buffer memory, scene graph complexity.

**Self as Audience:**

> "What if I am also the audience for my own tools?"
> — *project-brainstorm.md*

Documentation as primary output. The trail *is* the product.

## 4. What Are the Contexts of Use?

**During design processes:** Privacy Value Labels maps information flows during UX research. LEGOS framework (Location, Entities, Goals, Obstacles, Shifts) provides vocabulary for scenario articulation. **Mobile-first = available in the meeting**, not after.

**During organizational navigation:** Role Deck helps practitioners identify their game position within organizations. "We need more Socializers on this committee" becomes a legitimate coalition-building move.

**During collaborative speculation:** Thousand-Tetrad supports real-time scenario forking during workshops. Any state can fork; the substrate stays invariant.

**During post-session sharing:** The shift from live LLM construction to prebaked formats (disc-data.json) enables outputs to be shared, critiqued, built upon without API access.

**The De Certeau Framing:**

> "A tactic is a calculated action determined by the absence of a proper locus... It must play on and with a terrain imposed on it and organized by the law of a foreign power."
> — *decerteau-tactics-paper.md*

Users operate **within** strategic spaces they don't own (AI platforms, organizational contexts). The toolkit provides **tactical repertoires** for those who dwell in spaces they cannot control.

## 5. What Levers, Leverage Points, and Regulatory Modes?

### Shilton's Values Levers

The toolkit creates **openings for values discussions** by:
- Making information flows visible (Privacy Value Labels)
- Making ethical identities explorable (Role Deck)
- Making toolkit mythologies explicit (Haunted Tools)

### Meadows's Leverage Points (via Ehrlichman)

| Level | Type | Intervention |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 4 | Infrastructure | disc-data.json export format |
| 3 | Information Flows | Trail visibility; scenario exploration logs |
| 2 | Organizing Principles | 9×9 invariant grid; transfer audit requirement |
| **1** | **Mindsets** | **"LLM manages void, not scene"** |

> "The void management thesis argues that the shift from 'AI creates content' to 'AI prepares possibility spaces' represents a paradigm-level intervention—Meadows' highest leverage point. This shift changes not just *what* the system does but *how we conceptualize what the system is*."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

### Lessig's Regulatory Modes

**Liberty Machines** maps Law, Norms, Market, and Code as interactive forces—using the cigarette pack as case study in "freedom theatre."

Key insight:

> "Architecture/code is as powerful as law—often more powerful because invisible. The system prompt is constitutional design for AI collaboration."
> — *final-submission-v3.md*

### The De Certeau Meta-Framework

The entire toolkit can be understood through De Certeau's tactics/strategy distinction:

| Tactic | Strategic Space Parasitized | Tool |
|--------|----------------------------|------|
| **La Perruque** (doing own work on company time) | Corporate AI licenses | POML Library |
| **Textual Poaching** (reading as rewriting) | LLM guardrails | Prompt injection defense |
| **Making Do / Bricolage** | API limitations | Context sintering |
| **Mētis** (cunning) | Compliance frameworks | Compliance-as-trojan |

> "You cannot own the Void. But you can dwell tactically within it."
> — *decerteau-tactics-paper.md*

## 6. What Was Your Design/Creation Process?

**Phase 0: TILTH — The Failure**

Built a speculative company (Agronica) to explore through generative accumulation. Failed due to **complexity grey**—a world inside a world that couldn't maintain coherency. Stuck in "trough of quality."

> "TILTH exhibited the exact scene management failure the thesis describes. The project became its own complexity grey."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

**Phase 1: Thousand-Tetrad — The Discovery**

Recognized that better speculative worlds already existed (Ted Chiang, Life After Bob). Extracted tetrad controller mechanics. Non-negotiable constraint: **must work on phone**. This alone eliminated most accumulated complexity.

**Phase 2: HOLO — The Transition**

Transitioned from 2D to 3D. Technical problems with live LLM scene construction. The frustration revealed the error:

> "The LLM was not supposed to build the scene. It was supposed to manage the **void**."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

**Phase 3: TRACTOR — The Synthesis**

- **Before:** LLM manages scene → complexity → friction
- **After:** LLM manages void → possibility space → user selects → agency preserved

**Phase 4: Modulex/LEGO — The Planning Architecture**

Adopted Modulex planning logic from LEGO's 1966 spin-off. Shifted to Plancopy—"flat" planning with alphanumeric tiles on grid.

> "Plancopy's commercial success came from *reducing* LEGO's geometric freedom, not expanding it. The project's viability came from the same reduction. Flatness is not poverty. Flatness is discipline."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

**The Methodological Principle:**

> "Negative space programming: build till it fits a key. The constraint comes first; the content is generated until it snaps into the constraint's shape. This inverts conventional development."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

---

## 7. What Did You Learn or Reflect On?

### On Negative Space Programming

> "Generative abundance must be disciplined by structural scarcity. The shape of the key determines what the generation produces. Build the key first."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

### On Mētis vs. Techne

> "Scene management represents pure techne: the ambition to systematically encode all relevant information into a state that the AI can manipulate algorithmically. This ambition fails for the same reason state-led high-modernist projects fail—it cannot accommodate the mētis of situated human judgment. Void management preserves mētis by design."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

### On Invariant Patterns

The 9×9 grid + chat + tetrad structure works for privacy scenarios, ethical negotiations, speculative worldbuilding alike. Patterns that stay invariant scale better than patterns that accumulate context.

### On the Disclosure Double-Bind

> "Minimal disclosure performs compliance but misrepresents depth of engagement; full disclosure produces volumes that read as dependency rather than fluency."
> — *paragon-essay.md*

The solution: trail visibility as observation, not confession.

### On Technical Thresholds

Learned context engineering, ring buffer memory, scene graph complexity, linear algebra for 3D transformations. Not yet technical enough for multi-agent systems—but learned enormously about what "enough" would mean.

### On Collaboration Without Platform

> "The better approach was producing documents, prompt guides, and hands-on friction exposure—then getting out of the way to observe."
> — *final-project-writeup.md*

### On the Falsifiability of Void Management

The thesis produces a testable prediction:

> "A properly designed void-managed system should sustain >20 cumulative modifications without coherence collapse. A scene-managed system will exhibit measurable coherence loss within 10-15 modifications."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

## 8. Future Directions

1. **LDraw/LEGO Integration**: The Jessiman Morphism—applying the patterns that enabled a thirty-year open-source digital brick ecosystem to AI context engineering.

2. **Open-Source LLM Adaptation**: Restructure for lower-cost models without API dependency (Tehri's push).

3. **Multi-Agent Architectures**: Moving toward Generative Agents model with persistent memory and social dynamics.

4. **Physical Artifacts**: Printed Haunted Tools and Role Deck cards for workshops.

5. **POML Development**: Expanding the prompt library into formal infrastructure for community registry.

6. **Transclusion Engine**: 

> "The ten intervention files are the sintered artifacts of the project. They are the grain boundaries where the theoretical powder meets the practical heat... What we need now is a transclusion engine."
> — *atlas-of-interventions.md*

7. **Trail-Aware Policy**: Position paper on observation vs. confession in AI disclosure frameworks.

---

## 9. Other Reflections (The Whole Repo)

**The Jessiman Morphism:**

James Jessiman, a twenty-six-year-old Australian who died in 1997, created LDraw—a plain-text format for defining LEGO bricks that outlasted corporate alternatives for thirty years. His insight: a brick could be a word.

> "The brick was the first digital object to be fully democratized, standardized, and governed by its users. The context window is the second."
> — *wag-genome-jessiman.md*

**The Core Insight:**

> "The jar was round. The wilderness surrounded it. And for the first time, the wilderness made sense."
> — *void-management-thesis-paper.md*

**The Open Question:**

> "Can tactics ever transform into strategy without losing their tactical character? Can a collection of POML operators, sintering practices, and community formations ever constitute an 'infrastructure' without becoming the new surveilled space?"
> — *decerteau-tactics-paper.md*

This is Wong's "tempered radical's dilemma"—and the question the project leaves unresolved.

**The Trail as Artifact:**

> "The essays are the grains. The interventions are the powder. The engine is the heat. We are sintering the corpus."
> — *atlas-of-interventions.md*
