    NSP ORIGIN: These theorists establish the foundational insight that 
    human cognition and software systems have HARD LIMITS. The response 
    to limits is not expansion but CONSTRAINT DESIGN.

    "I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the

    vulnerabilities, and system crashes." — Hoare (2009)

  thesis_connection: |
    CORE NSP PRINCIPLE: A representable invalid state (null) IS ALWAYS 
    REACHABLE. The solution is not runtime checking but type-level 
    elimination. Option<T> = Some(T) | None eliminates null at compile time.

    PHYSICAL NSP: Modulex is the earliest documented instance of 
    CONSTRAINT DESIGN IN PLASTIC. The 1:1:1 cube geometry makes scaling 
    errors structurally impossible — invalid states are unrepresentable.

    "Certain forms of knowledge and control require a narrowing of vision.

  thesis_connection: |
    LEGIBILITY: Scott's critique of state legibility projects IS the 
    critique of infinite context windows. The state wants to SEE everything; 
    but seeing everything means seeing nothing deeply. Metis (local knowledge) 
    is the opposite of "context soup."

    refinement of model accuracy or the expansion of context windows,

  thesis_connection: |
    THIS IS THE THESIS: The Void is the space of all possible outputs.
    The Scene is the constrained, situated context. Sintering is the 
    process of applying "heat" (prompts, constraints) to consolidate 
    the Void into a usable Scene. POML operators ARE sintering tools.
